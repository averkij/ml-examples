# Machine learning examples

Some of my notebooks made during ML discovering.

## Anomaly and novelty detection (unsupervised)

```
#statistics #shapiro #threat-detection #decision-trees #lstm
```

### Objective

Find any unusualness like breach in the industrial system, anomaly activity like a fraud or other threats or novelty we want to detect. The data is a multivariable timeseries.
