<p><b>Staphylus</b> (Ancient Greek: <span lang="grc">Στάφυλος</span> "grape cluster") is one of several personages of ancient Greek mythology, almost always associated with grapes or wine: </p> <ul><li>The son of wine-god Dionysus and Ariadne. His brothers include Oenopion ("wine drinker"), Thoas, Peparethus, Phanus and Euanthes ("the richly blooming"). Both Staphylus and Phanus are counted among the Argonauts. As one of Rhadamanthys' generals, he was the founder of the colony of Peparethos on the island of Skopelos in the Northern Sporades island chain. Staphylus dwelt in Naxos and was married to Chrysothemis, by whom he had three daughters: Rhoeo, who was a lover to Apollo, Parthenos, and Molpadia or Hemithea. The latter became the mother of Basileus with Lyrcus, after Lyrcus had made a journey to the oracle at Didyma. Staphylus is said to have enticed Lyrcus into too much drinking of wine and then when his senses were dulled by drunkenness united him with Hemithea.</li> <li>The beloved of Dionysus, from the island of Thasos. It is thanks to Dionysus' love for him that Thasian wine is distinguished.</li> <li>In a reconstructed myth, the son of Bacchus and Erigone, where Bacchus assumed the form of a grape which Erigone ate. She immediately realized that she was with child and in time gave birth to a son whom she named Staphylus.</li> <li>The husband of Methe and father of Botrys. The family held court in their palace at Assyria. They received Dionysus as guest and held a banquet in his honor. Staphylus died a sudden death the next morning after the feast; to console his wife and son, Dionysus named grape bunches after Staphylus, drunkenness after Methe, and grapes after Botrys.</li> <li>Son of Oenomaus, who fought on Dionysus' side against Poseidon in the conflict of the two gods concerning Beroe.</li> <li>Son of Silenus, who introduced the practice of mixing wine with water.</li> <li>A goatherd of King Oeneus, who discovered wild grapes as he was pasturing the king's goats and saw one of them chewing on the plant. He presented it to Oeneus, who in his turn invented the way of making the grapes into a drink. When Dionysus visited Oeneus, the king served him the new drink. Dionysus suggested that the drink be named <i>oinos</i> (wine) after Oeneus, and the grapes <i>staphyloi</i> after the goatherd Staphylus.</li></ul>
<p>The <b>recorded history of the Caribbean island of Grenada</b> begins in the early 17th century. First settled by indigenous peoples, by the time of European contact it was inhabited by the Caribs. French colonists drove most of the Caribs off the island and established plantations on the island, eventually importing African slaves to work on the sugar plantations. </p><p>Control of the island was disputed by Great Britain and France in the 18th century, with the British ultimately prevailing. In 1795, Fédon's Rebellion, inspired by the Haitian Revolution, very nearly succeeded, and was crushed with significant military intervention. Slavery was abolished in the 1830s. In 1885, the island became the capital of the British Windward Islands. </p><p>Grenada achieved independence from Britain in 1974. Following a coup by the Marxist New Jewel Movement in 1983, the island was invaded by United States troops and the government overthrown.

<p><b>Richard Krautheimer</b> (6 July 1897 in Fürth (Franconia), Germany – 1 November 1994 in Rome, Italy) was a 20th-century art historian, architectural historian, Baroque scholar, and Byzantinist. </p><p>He was born in Germany in 1897, the son of Nathan Krautheimer (1854–1910) and Martha Landmann (Krautheimer) (1875–1967). Krautheimer's cousin, Ernst Kitzinger, would also become a prominent Byzantinist. Krautheimer fought in the First World War as an enlisted soldier in the German army (1916–18). Between 1919–23, he initially studied law at, successively, universities in Munich, Berlin, and Marburg under faculty who included Heinrich Wölfflin, Adolf Goldschmidt and Werner Weisbach. During these years, he briefly worked on the state inventory of Churches for Erfurt (<i>Inventarisierung der Erfurter Kirchen für die Preussische Denkmalpflege</i>). In 1924 he married Trude Hess (1902 - 1987), who subsequently also studied art history and became a noted scholar and collector herself. He completed his dissertation in Halle under Paul Frankl in 1925 with the title <i>Die Kirchen der Bettelorden in Deutschland (1240–1340)</i>.  Frankl's work remained a strong influence for Krautheimer throughout his life. Willibald Sauerländer contends that it was Krautheimer who later introduced Frankl's work to the United States.  The systematizing methodology of Krautheimer's mentor, Frankl, "never left Krautheimer" according to Willibald Sauerlander. </p><p>In 1927 he completed his habilitation under Richard Hamann in Marburg. The same year, while researching at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, Krautheimer developed the idea for a handbook of Roman churches with a colleague, Rudolf Wittkower, later to become the <i>Corpus Basilicarum</i>. In 1928 he accepted a <i>privatdozent</i> teaching position at Marburg. Except for studies-in-residence at the Hertziana (1930/31, 32/33) he remained at Marburg. The Krautheimers fled Nazi persecution, leaving Germany for good. Between 1933–35 Krautheimer worked on the <i>Corpus</i>, accepting paying employment from Frankl's son in the city. The ever-declining political situation for Jews in Axis-alliance countries compelled the Krautheimers to emigrate to the United States of America. Krautheimer found a position at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, a university he purportedly had never heard of. At his request, Louisville hired another fleeing art historian, Krautheimer's friend from school days, Justus Bier. Krautheimer moved to Vassar in 1937 at the request of Vassar's Art Department chair, Agnes Claflin. That same year saw Krautheimer's first volume of the <i>Corpus Basilicarum Christianarum Romae</i>, a scholarly inventory and documentation of the early Christian churches in Rome eventually running to five volumes. The set would not be completed until 1977. Following US entry into World War II, he and Trude became naturalized citizens. Richard volunteered for duty as a senior research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services for the years 1942–44. Here he analyzed aerial photographs of Rome to assist in the protection of historic buildings during bombing. While still at Vassar, he taught (with lecturer status) at New York University (1938–49). He moved to NYU permanently in 1952 as the Jayne Wrightsman Professor of Fine Arts. The early 1950s were devoted to researching his one monograph on an artist, Lorenzo Ghiberti, published jointly with his wife in 1956. He would serve for one semester as acting Director of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. </p><p>Krautheimer next engaged in what he called his most difficult book to research and write: the survey volume on early Christian architecture for the Pelican History of Art. The manuscript was completed in 1963 and published two years later. The volume turned out to be one of the finest syntheses of late antique/early medieval architecture published and brought Krautheimer his widest readership. He revised and reissued the work twice, in 1975 and 1979. After a second tome on Ghiberti in 1971, Krautheimer retired from NYU as Samuel F. B. Morse Professor <i>Emeritus</i> and returned to Rome. Wolfgang Lotz, friend and fellow architectural historian, offered him a residence at the Bibliotheca Hertziana. There, Krautheimer completed his long-standing research on the <i>Corpus Basilicarum</i>. In these final years he set to work writing two of his most synthetic and lyrical works on art history. <i>Rome: Profile of a City</i> (1980) and <i>The Rome of Alexander VII</i> (1985) combined social history, vast breadth of archival knowledge and insightful architectural history into single volumes. In both cases, Krautheimer selected comparatively neglected periods in Roman history to offer a compelling narrative of the interaction of public works and patronage. While assisting friends with plans for his 100th birthday, Krautheimer died at 97 at the Palazzo Zuccari. His wife had preceded him in death seven years before.  His many students at New York University included Howard Saalman, Leo Steinberg, James S. Ackerman, Frances Huemer, Marvin Trachtenberg, Slobodan Curcic, and Dale Kinney. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p><i><b>Over The Top</b></i> is a 1918 oil-on-canvas painting by John Nash.  It depicts a counter-attack on Welsh Ridge in northern France on 30 December 1917, during the First World War.    It is held by Imperial War Museum, London. </p><p>The painting measures 79.8 × 108 centimetres (31.4 × 42.5 in).  It shows British soldiers in heavy winter greatcoats scrambling up from their trenches to advance over a snow-covered landscape.  Two already lie dead or wounded on the duckboards in the base of the trench and one on the snow.  The others move to the right without looking back.  Threatening clouds hang in the sky above, billowing darkly.  Two studies held by the Imperial War museum show the carefully balanced composition. </p><p>The painting is based on Nash's experience while serving in the 1st Battalion of the Artists Rifles (28th London Regiment).  His unit went "over the top", to push towards Marcoing near Cambrai. Of the 80 men, 68 were killed or wounded by the shell-fire during the first few minutes. Nash was one of the 12 that survived.  He made the painting in early 1918, having returned to England and been recommended by his brother Paul Nash to become an official war artist.  The work was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and painted in a rented seed-shed at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. </p> <ul class="gallery mw-gallery-traditional"><li class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px"> 		<li class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px"> </ul>

According to Zhukov, Stalin had conducted liberal reforms in the USSR, and launched the purges against real threats to Soviet security. Zhukov has also argued that by assuming sole power, Stalin had "saved the country and the world" from Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev, for in Zhukov's view, their revolutionary politics brought the USSR into conflict with the world. Historian Gennady Kostyrchenko remarked that virtually all of Yuri Zhukov's historical works, that have been published in the last 15-17, have had the moral and political rehabilitation of Stalin as their overriding theme.</p>

It became part of the syllabuses of Persian schools and is mentioned in a manuscript-copy of <i>Khulasatul Makatib</i>, written in 1688. From its popular use in Persian schools, educated men and women, both Muslims and Hindus, were commonly acquainted with it in Mughal India.

<p>A <b>legendary</b>, <b>mythical</b>, or <b>mythological creature</b>, traditionally called a <b>fabulous beast</b> or <b>fabulous creature</b>, is a  fictitious, imaginary and often supernatural animal, often a hybrid, sometimes part human, whose existence has not or cannot be proved and that is described in folklore or fiction but also in historical accounts before history became a science. </p><p>In the classical era, monstrous creatures such as the Cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity. Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures, for example dragons, griffins, and unicorns. Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, which supposedly grew tethered to the earth.</p>

<p>In Inuit mythology, an <b>inua</b> (ᐃᓄᐊ; plural <b>inuat</b> ᐃᓄᐊᑦ, literally "possessor" or "master") is a spirit or soul that exists in all people, animals, lakes, mountains, and plants.  They were sometimes personified in mythology.  The concept is similar to mana. For arctic people, human and animals are equal - All life has the same kind of soul or "life essence" (inua). This creates a predicament that, in order to survive people must kill other creatures that are like them. Recognition of this dilemma lies at the centre of hunting practice, which is based upon respect and reciprocity. The hunter will only succeed if the animal chooses to give its life as a gift in return for moral and respectful behaviour on the part of the whole community. For example, after a seal has been killed fresh water is poured into its mouth so that its soul will not be thirsty and it will tell the other seals of the respect shown to it. </p><p>Among the Yu'pik near Kuskokwim Bay of Coastal Alaska, the word <b>yua</b> (absolutive case form of the word <i>yuk</i> "human; human-like spirit") has similar connotations as that of the Iñupiaq of Northern Alaska, who similar to the Inuit call it <i>iñua</i> or <i>inua</i>. For both the Yu'piak and Iñupiaq, the meaning is closest to an understanding of a world in which "Most Arctic peoples believe all the world is animate, and that animals have souls or spirits", (Berlo and Phillips 161) a foundational belief of the continuum and inter-connectivity of all life and spirit of all that which is, that which has been, and that which is yet to be. </p>

It replaced the Sassanid capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon some 35 km to the south-east, which was mostly depopulated by the end of the 8th century. Baghdad was the center of the Arab caliphate during the "Golden Age of Islam" of the 9th and 10th centuries, growing to be the largest city worldwide  by the beginning of the 10th century. It began to decline in the "Iranian Intermezzo" of the 9th to 11th centuries, and was destroyed in the Mongolian invasion in 1258. </p><p>The city was rebuilt and flourished under Ilkhanid rule but never rose to its former glory again. It was again sacked by Timur in 1401 and fell under Turkic rule. It was briefly taken by  Safavid Persia in 1508, before falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1534. With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Baghdad fell under the British Mandate in 1920 and became the capital of the independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932 (converted to a Republic in 1958). </p><p>As the capital of the modern Republic of Iraq, Baghdad has  a metropolitan area estimated at a population of 7,000,000 divided into numerous neighbourhoods in nine districts. It is the largest city in Iraq. It is the second-largest city in the Arab world (after Cairo) and the second-largest city in Western Asia (after Tehran). In recent history, Baghdad has been affected by the Iraqi civil war, most notably by recurring bombings. </p>

<p>The <b>Skulpturhalle Basel</b> is a museum in Basel, Switzerland, featuring cast replicas of antique sculpture.  With around 2,000 casts it is the largest collection of its kind in the country, having tripled in size between 1985 and 2010.  Since 1961 the collection has been managed by the Antikenmuseum Basel. </p><p>The collection was started in 1830.  From 1849 it was located in the newly opened <i>Museum an der Augustinergasse</i> (now the location of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures).  In 1887 it moved into the Basel Kunsthalle, where a new wing known as the "Skulpturenhalle" had been built especially for it.  The casts had to be warehoused in 1927 when the national art collection was temporarily moved into the Kunsthalle, creating a need for more space.  In 1940 the cast collection found a provisional home in a disused factory, four years after plans for a new building had failed to pass a referendum; the new building finally materialised in 1963. </p><p>When original works are split into pieces across various museums, the casts allow all the parts to be brought back together so that complete reconstructions of antique sculptures can be made.  The unique "Parthenon Project" assembles casts of every surviving sculptural remnant from the Parthenon Temple in Athens, and exhibits them so as to demonstrate their original arrangements.  Also in the exhibition is an array of architectural models on a scale of 1:20. </p>

During the Civil War it was garrisoned, and was a site of several skirmishes. </p><p>Local villagers believe that this is the historic site that inspired Kanu, the UK grime artist Kano to write the award winning album of Made In The Mano, as he would often visit this manor house in his childhood and the picture of the hall inspired the story behind the song, <i>T-Shirt Weather In The Manor</i>. </p><p>The garden is largely the product of two tenants. George Maw (1832–1912), local pottery manufacturer and crocus enthusiast developed the garden from around 1865 onwards. Subsequently, the Victorian era Romantic painter and sculptor Robert Bateman (1842–1922), who was the son of a famous horticulturalist, added the rockeries and terraces of the current garden. </p><p>The Commonwealth era church of St. Bartholomew stands close by the Hall. The Shropshire Way, a waymarked long-distance footpath, passes through the extensive woodland that lies to the north, between the estate and the River Severn. </p>

In Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>, Athena creates an image in Iphthime's likeness and sends this to a sleeping Penelope. This image conveys encouragement to Penelope after the latter confides in it her worries for her husband Odysseus and her son Telemachus. Scholiasts on Homer inform that she was also known under several other names: Hypsipyle, Mede, Laodice or Laodamia, and that her mother was Asterodia.</li> <li>Iphthime, daughter of Dorus, mother of the Satyrs Lycus, Pherespondus and Pronomus by Hermes.</li></ul>

<p>The <b>Würzburg Residence</b> (German: <i>Würzburger Residenz</i>) is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by  the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and  completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building.  </p><p>Interiors considered masterworks of Baroque/Rococo or Neoclassical architecture and art include the grand staircase, the chapel, and the Imperial Hall. The building was reportedly called the "largest parsonage in Europe" by Napoleon. It was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II, and restoration has been in progress since 1945.

In British heraldry, <i>lindworm</i> is a technical term for a wingless serpentine monster with two clawed arms in the upper body. In Norwegian heraldry a <i>lindorm</i> is the same as the wyvern in British heraldry. </p><p>A lindworm's appearance can vary from country to country and from tale to tale, but the most common depiction of lindworm is a wingless lindworm with a serpentine body, a dragon-like head, scaled or reptilian skin and two clawed arms in the upper body. The most common depiction of lindworms implies that such lindworms do not walk on their two limbs like a wyvern, but move like a mole lizard: they slither like a snake but they also use their arms to move themselves. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt">   </p>  <p>The <i><b>Orkneyinga saga</b></i> (also called the <i><b>History of the Earls of Orkney</b></i> and <i><b>Jarls' Saga</b></i>) is a historical narrative of the history of the Orkney and Shetland islands and their relationship with other local polities, particularly Norway and Scotland. The saga has "no parallel in the social and literary record of Scotland" and is "the only medieval chronicle to have Orkney as the central place of action". The main focus of the work is the line of <i>jarls</i> who ruled the Earldom of Orkney, which constituted the <i>Norðreyjar</i> or Northern Isles of both Orkney and Shetland and there are frequent references to both archipelagoes throughout.</p><p>The narrative commences with a brief mythical ancestry tale and then proceeds to outline the Norse take-over of the <i>Norðreyjar</i> by Harald Fairhair – the former event is not in doubt although the role of the latter King of Norway is no longer accepted by historians as a likelihood. The saga then outlines, with varying degrees of detail, the lives and times of the many <i>jarls</i> who ruled the islands between the 9th and 13th centuries. The extent to which the earlier sections in particular can be considered genuine history rather than fiction have been much debated by scholars. </p><p>There are several recurring themes in the <i>Orkneyinga saga</i>, including strife between brothers, relationships between the jarls and the Norwegian crown, and raiding in the <i>Suðreyjar</i> – the Hebrides. In part, the saga's purpose was to provide a history of the islands and enable its readers to "understand themselves through a knowledge of their origins" but even where its historical veracity is lacking it provides modern scholars with insights into the motives of the writers and the politics of 13th century Orkney. </p>

<p><b>Vis and Rāmin</b> (Persian: <span lang="fa" dir="rtl">ويس و رامين</span>‎, <i>Vis o Rāmin</i>) is an ancient Persian love story. The epic was composed in poetry by the Persian poet Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani (or "Gorgani") in the 11th century. </p><p>The story dates from pre-Islamic Persia. Gorgani claimed a Sassanid origin for it, but it is now regarded as of Parthian dynastic origin, probably from the 1st century AD. It has also been suggested that Gorgani's story reflects the traditions and customs of the period immediately before he himself lived. That cannot be ruled out, as stories retold from ancient sources often include elements drawn from the time of their narrator.</p>
<p><b>Kinnordy House</b> (alternative spellings: Kynnordy, Kinardy, Kinnordie and Kinorde) is an estate house near Kirriemuir in Angus, Scotland.

<p><i><b>The Book of Urizen</b></i> is one of the major prophetic books of the English writer William Blake, illustrated by Blake's own plates. It was originally published as <i><b>The First Book of Urizen</b></i> in 1794. Later editions dropped the "First". The book takes its name from the character Urizen in Blake's mythology, who represents alienated reason as the source of oppression. The book describes Urizen as the "primeaval priest" and tells how he became separated from the other Eternals to create his own alienated and enslaving realm of religious dogma. Los and Enitharmon create a space within Urizen's fallen universe to give birth to their son Orc, the spirit of revolution and freedom. </p><p>In form the book is a parody of the Book of Genesis.

He first came to Warm Springs (formerly known as Bullochville) in 1924 for polio treatment, and liked the area so much that, as Governor of New York, he had a home built on nearby Pine Mountain. The house was finished in 1932. Roosevelt kept the house after he became President, using it as a presidential retreat. He died there on April 12, 1945, three months into his fourth term. </p><p>The house was opened to the public as a museum in 1948. A major attraction of the museum is the portrait that the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff was painting of him when he died, now known as the "Unfinished Portrait".

<p>The <b>John Humphreys House</b>, also known as <b>Sir John Humphreys House</b>, is a historic house museum located at 99 Paradise Road in Swampscott, Massachusetts.  Although it was long thought to be associated with John Humphrey, an early deputy governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, it was more likely built about 1700, based on architectural analysis. In 1641 Deborah Moody bought the Humphrey house (which he called Swampscott) and 900 acres when the Humphreys returned to England giving her over 1300 acres of what would become Swampscott, Massachusetts.  The house was originally located on what is now Elmwood Road (a plaque marks the site), but moved to its current location in 1891 as the Olmsted district was developed. It is currently owned by the Swampscott Historical Society.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.</p>

<dl><dd><i>For the eponymous structure in Constantinople, see Church of the Holy Apostles.</i>The <b>Church of the Twelve Apostles</b> (Russian: <span lang="ru">церковь Двенадцати Апостолов</span>) is a minor cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, commissioned by Patriarch Nikon as part of his stately residence in 1653 and dedicated to Philip the Apostle three years later. It also serves as a part of Moscow Kremlin Museums.</dd></dl><p> Although premises for the Muscovite metropolitan had existed in the Kremlin ever since the 14th century, Patriarch Nikon, who aspired to rival the tsar in authority and magnificence, had them replaced with a much more ambitious residence, centered on a spacious chamber in the form of the cross, once used as a banqueting hall but now serving as a museum of applied arts. To this structure adjoins from the south a domestic church of the patriarchs, originally consecrated to Philip the Apostle until the dedication was altered to the present one in 1682. </p> <p>The church is almost as prominent as neighbouring grand cathedrals of the 15th century, due to its placement upon a high podium, pierced by two large arches allowing passage from the Cathedral Square to the patriarch's courtyard. The exterior walls are decorated with two belts of columned arches which reference both the neighbouring cathedrals of the Cathedral Square and the great churches of the 12th-century Vladimir-Suzdal school which had been their inspiration. The rigorous outline of five helmeted domes, in keeping with Nikon's conservative architectural tastes, serves to accentuate the church's Byzantine pedigree. </p><p>The patriarchal residence was seriously damaged when the Bolsheviks shelled the Kremlin in October 1917. Subsequently, the church was restored in order to accommodate the applied arts museum. Very little subsists of its original murals, yet there is a delightful 17th-century iconostasis, salvaged from the Ascension Convent cathedral upon its demolition by the Bolsheviks and displaying many fine old icons, notably those by Fyodor Zubov and Simon Ushakov. </p>  <p><span></span> </p>

<p>In contemporary fantasy literature, a <b>stray sod</b> is a clump of grass enchanted by faeries. If a person steps on one, they will become disorientated and lost, even in familiar surroundings. Wearing an item of clothing inside-out breaks the enchantment, allowing the person to find their way again. The concept and phrase appear to originate in ancient Celtic mythology, specifically Irish folklore. In more modern Christianized interpretations, the source of the enchantment may not be fairies. </p><p>In other writing and in speech, the phrase "stepped on a stray sod" can be used metaphorically to denote sudden, unexpected or inexplicable disorientation.</p><p>Stray sods appear in the series <i>The Spiderwick Chronicles</i>, disorienting travelers. The companion guide to the series notes that in order to reverse the effects, one must either have bread in his or her pocket or turn their clothes inside out. </p><p>A stray sod also appears in the webcomic "Stray Sod" by Chelsea Crutchley,where the heroine's sister steps on one and mysteriously disappears. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p>The <b>Franks Casket</b> (or the <b>Auzon Casket</b>) is a small Anglo-Saxon whale's bone (not "whalebone" in the sense of baleen) chest from the early 8th century, now in the British Museum.  The casket is densely decorated with knife-cut narrative scenes in flat two-dimensional low-relief and with inscriptions mostly in Anglo-Saxon runes.  Generally reckoned to be of Northumbrian origin, it is of unique importance for the insight it gives into early Anglo-Saxon art and culture.  Both identifying the images and interpreting the runic inscriptions has generated a considerable amount of scholarship.</p><p>The imagery is very diverse in its subject matter and derivations, and includes a single Christian image, the Adoration of the Magi, along with images derived from Roman history (Emperor Titus) and Roman mythology (Romulus and Remus), as well as a depiction of at least one legend indigenous to the Germanic peoples: that of Weyland the Smith.  It has also been suggested that there may be an episode from the Sigurd legend, an otherwise lost episode from the life of Weyland's brother Egil, a Homeric legend involving Achilles, and perhaps even an allusion to the legendary founding of England by Hengist and Horsa. </p><p>The inscriptions "display a deliberate linguistic and alphabetic virtuosity; though they are mostly written in Old English and in runes, they shift into Latin and the Roman alphabet; then back into runes while still writing Latin".  Some are written upside down or back to front.</p>

They were accomplished over 12 years at the service of King Eurystheus. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an epic poem, now lost, written by Peisander, dated about 600 BC. After Hercules killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Hercules was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for 12 years.

<p><b>Ilie Bărbulescu</b> (December 3, 1873 – June 5, 1945) was a Romanian linguist and philologist who specialized in the Slavic languages, also noted as a political journalist and Conservative Party cadre. Academically trained in his native country and in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, he investigated in particular the Slavic influence on Romanian and the origins of Romanian literature, with additional interests in Old East Slavic and Russian literature. He was a corresponding member of the Romanian and Serbian Academies, and helped establish a Slavic studies department at the University of Iași. Bărbulescu was nevertheless a controversial figure, deeply involved in academic rivalries, and taking up unpopular political stances—especially during World War I, when, contrary to his background in Slavistics, he took up "Germanophilia", rooting for the Central Powers. </p><p>Published by <i>Viața Romînească</i> and <i>Seara</i>, Bărbulescu's political essays caused public outrage by questioning the motives of Romanian nationalists. He was largely silent after declared war on the Central Powers, but returned to prominence after her surrender in April 1918. With a Germanophile triumph apparent, he was elected dean, became editor of the newspaper <i>Iașiul</i>, and served for several months as a Conservative in the Senate of Romania. He was demoted, and narrowly escaped being laid off, following the Armistice of November. Bărbulescu returned to his research, for which he was rewarded with a membership in the Czech Society; he was nevertheless defeated in his bid to become a full member of the Romanian Academy, attributing this failure to political resentments and a Masonic conspiracy. </p>

<p>The <b>Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array</b> (<b>VLA</b>) is a centimeter-wavelength radio astronomy observatory located in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, ~50 miles (80 km) west of Socorro. The VLA comprises twenty-seven 25-meter radio telescopes deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission. </p><p>The VLA stands at an elevation of 6970 ft (2124 m) above sea level.

These included the wholesale business, cattle ranching, the railroads, and banking, At his death in 1889, Fowler had accumulated a fortune of several million dollars. Following his death, his wife Eliza was a generous donor to various community interests including Purdue University. Eliza Fowler Hall (razed) at Purdue University was named in her honor.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>In 1902, Moses Fowler’s grandson, Cecil G. Fowler, inherited the house and he and his wife Louise made it their residence. Cecil had followed his father and grandfather into banking but was also a developer. He partnered with Carl Fischer (developer of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway) to build the first luxury hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, which opened on New Year's Eve 1920. In 1916-17, the Fowlers moved out of the house while significant renovations and additions were completed. During this time a large Tudor style formal dining room and living room were added, along with an indoor kitchen, laundry, garage, and servants quarters. The upstairs now included seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. These included a new guest bedroom, master suite, and servants bedrooms. Outside, a large Italian style tiered patio with fountains, a reflecting pool, a tea house, and formal gardens were added. The Fowlers loved to entertain and were well known locally for the large and extravagant parties they hosted. In 1940, with their children grown, the Fowlers sold the house to the Tippecanoe County Historical Association. </p>  <p>From 1940 until 2015, the Moses Fowler House was the home of the Tippecanoe County Historical Association and used at various times as a museum, offices, and for collections storage. </p>  <p>In 2015, The 1852 Foundation (a 501c3 non-profit public charity) was founded through the generosity of Matt and Dr. Ann Jonkman. The 1852 Foundation purchased the Fowler House Mansion and from 2015-2018 completed over $1.3 million in restorations, repairs, code updates, and facility additions in order that the house could be open to and used by the  public for tours and as an events venue. This mission of The 1852 Foundation is to preserve the Fowler House Mansion and share its history with the public, as an asset to the community. The Foundation hosts a number of educational and fundraising events each year. The house with its new state of the art commercial catering kitchen provides complete catering and beverage services.  </p>
<p>A <b>hypothetical Axis victory in World War II</b> has become a common concept of alternative history and counterfactual history. Such writings express ideas of what the world would be like had the Axis powers of Germany, Italy and  Japan won World War II. Numerous examples exist in several languages worldwide.</p><p>The term <b>Pax Germanica</b>, Latin for "German peace", is sometimes used for this theoretical period, by analogy to similar terms for peaceful historical periods. In some cases, this term is used for a hypothetical Imperial German victory in World War I as well, having a historical precedent in Latin texts referring to the Peace of Westphalia.</p><p>The subject of Axis supremacy as a fictional  dramatic device began in the English-speaking world before the start of World War II, with Katharine Burdekin's novel <i>Swastika Night</i> coming out in 1937. Subsequent popular fictional depictions of an Axis-powers victory include: <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> by Philip K. Dick (1962), <i>SS-GB</i> by Len Deighton (1978), and <i>Fatherland</i> by Robert Harris (1992). </p><p>Some have viewed the enduring interest in the "what-ifs" of an Axis-powers victory as the result of the resonance of related themes, for example, how ordinary individuals deal with the humiliation and anger of being dominated.</p>

It is three miles (4.8 km) south-east of the city centre, on a low hill to the south of the modern suburb of Craigmillar. The Preston family of Craigmillar, the local feudal barons, began building the castle in the late 14th century and building works continued through the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1660 the castle was sold to Sir John Gilmour, Lord President of the Court of Session, who made further alterations. The Gilmours left Craigmillar in the 18th century, and the castle fell into ruin. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.</p><p>Craigmillar Castle is best known for its association with Mary, Queen of Scots. Following an illness after the birth of her son, the future James VI, Mary arrived at Craigmillar on 20 November 1566 to convalesce. Before she left on 7 December 1566, a pact known as the "Craigmillar Bond" was made, with or without her knowledge, to dispose of her husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. </p><p>Craigmillar is one of the best-preserved medieval castles in Scotland.

The Blyth family subsequently moved to Birmingham. Notable descendents were Benjamin Blyth, Sir Arthur Blyth and Benjamin Blyth II. The house was subsequently let to a tenant farmer and his labourer, at which point the house was sub-divided into two dwellings. </p><p>In 1886 ownership passed to the Corporation (Sheffield City Council) and various recreation department employees lived in the house until 1974.</p><p>It is a Grade II* listed building and has been open as a museum since 1976, following a renovation funded by English Heritage and Sheffield City Council.  The Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust managed the building for some years until April 2011, when management of public opening, on behalf of the building's owner Sheffield City Council, was conferred to the Friends of Bishops' House.  The building is open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays between 10am and 4pm.

The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. There was a deliberate link with Caernarfon's Roman past and the Roman fort of Segontium is nearby. </p><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English. Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of 1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. Despite its dilapidated condition, during the English Civil War Caernarfon Castle was held by Royalists, and was besieged three times by Parliamentarian forces. This was the last time the castle was used in war. Caernarfon Castle was neglected until the 19th century when the state funded repairs. In 1911, Caernarfon Castle was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and again in 1969. It is part of the World Heritage Site "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd".</p>
<p>The <b>Middelaldercentret</b> (English: <span lang="en">The Medieval Centre</span>) is an experimental living history museum in Denmark, which depicts the middle ages in the Denmark of the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It is located in Sundby Lolland, some 4 km northwest of the centre of Nykøbing Falster on the waterfront of Guldborgsund. </p><p>It features a town built as part of a typical Danish market town with craftsmen, a harbour with ships and boats, and a market place.

In addition, a support association exists, from which a large group of volunteers participates in the daily work. All the involved people "live in the medieval period", which means that they do not know of modern things like television, cellphones and so on. The former curator of the centre was the historian, writer and lecturer Kåre Johannessen. By 2016, the curator was Thit Birk Petersen.</p><p>Besides normal museum activities, the Middle Ages Centre does extensive research within the middle ages and different medieval technologies, and the museum has reconstructed weapons, ships, clothing and diving equipment among others. The museum has a reputation of being the most authentic place in Europe within the medieval period.

<p><b>McLeod Plantation</b> is located at 325 Country Club Drive on James Island, South Carolina, near the intersection of Folly and Maybank Roads. Situated at Wappoo Creek which flows into the Ashley River, historic events have been recorded throughout the period from 1678 when it first appeared on maps under "Morris." The plantation house standing on the land today was constructed in about 1858 in the Georgian style. Also on the property are six clapboard slave cabins, a detached kitchen, a dairy building, a pre-war gin house for long-staple cotton, a barn, and a carriage house. The plantation is an important Gullah heritage site preserved in recognition of its cultural and historical significance. </p><p>In 1780 in the American War of Independence General Sir Henry Clinton used the original house as his headquarters while planning the siege of Charleston. The plantation was occupied by Confederate forces during most of the Civil War, and the home also served as a hospital. After the evacuation of Charleston in early 1865, it was occupied by the 55th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiments, which were African American soldiers. Later, the home was occupied as offices by the Freedmen's Bureau, and at one point, nearly newly freed slaves camped out on the plantation's lands. In 1926, The front and rear of the house were reversed, and the front facade was altered. </p><p>The South Carolina Department of Archives and History has additional information and photographs. The plantation was named one of the African American Historic Places in South Carolina.</p><p>The home was occupied by the McLeod family until 1990, and a share was given to the Historic Charleston Foundation who proceeded to consolidate shareholders. In 1993, ten acres were designated for the growing of sweetgrass to help ensure a supply of the basic component used in crafting sweetgrass baskets.</p><p>The plantation was sold to the American College of the Building Arts (ACBA) in 2004. Unable to support the development of their school and the plantation, ACBA returned it to Historic Charleston in 2008. </p>

<p>The <b>Lévis Forts</b> were a series of three forts located on the South Shore of the Saint Lawrence River in Lévis, Quebec, Canada. They were at shooting distance of one another which allowed the defense of a wide area without the cost of a continuous defensive wall.  The first one was built (1865-1872) by the British Army and the other ones by private businesses (1865-1869).  The costs were almost identical for all three, ranging from 57,600 to 59,762 pounds. </p><p>During the American Civil War, Great Britain claimed to remain neutral in the conflict. However, the cotton directly imported from the south of the United States still had a great importance in the British textile industry. Following the Civil War, the British were still expecting an American invasion of Canada. </p><p>The tense political relationship between Austria and Prussia had the British worried about their wood supply, if the access to the Baltic Sea was blocked. The Canadian forests would then be used as Great Britain's main wood supply. </p><p>Lieutenant-Colonel William Jervois was sent to Canada to establish the Canadian defence plan. He suggested that detached forts be built on Pointe-Lévy, on the south shore of Quebec City. The original plans recommended 5 forts, of which 3 were actually built. None of the three were ever occupied as they were no longer considered necessary after the signing of the Treaty of Washington in 1871.</p>

<p><b>Julian Raymond Dennis Cobbing</b> (born June 1944, London) is an English historian, and professor of History at Rhodes University (Grahamstown, South Africa), known best for his controversial and groundbreaking research into Zulu culture of the early 19th century. </p><p>Cobbing gained a BA from the University of London and a PhD from Lancaster University. He is regarded as the first historian to attempt to discredit conventional historical beliefs about the 'Mfecane' - a period of wars during the 1820s and 1830s that resulted in the emergence of the Zulu Kingdom. In a paper published in the <i>Journal of African History</i> in 1988, Cobbing argued that the Mfecane had been the construct of Apartheid politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of black South Africans by the white minority. Instead of an internally induced process of black-on-black destruction, Cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by European slave traders and settlers, who had contracted local tribal leaders to capture slaves for sale at Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). The rise of the Zulu state, under Cobbing's hypothesis, was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slave-trading activities of other tribes in the region, rather than a process of active internal aggression, as argued by some contemporary scholars. </p><p>Cobbing's hypothesis was highly controversial when first published. Several books and articles have been written focused on rebutting Cobbing's arguments – a prominent example being Roger B. Beck's <i>Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier</i>, which featured a collection of articles challenging Cobbing's contentions. Often now referred to as the "Cobbing controversy", historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the Zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the Mfecane. Most agree however that Cobbing's analysis offered several key breakthroughs, and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the Mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during Apartheid.</p><p>Cobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford in 2002. He currently lives in Grahamstown, South Africa, and recently retired from lecturing in history at Rhodes University, where his course "The Origins of the Modern World Crisis" was very popular. Cobbing's current work focuses on a variety of subjects including the history of <i>Homo sapiens</i> as a species and the modern world crisis. </p>
<p>Although the <b>History of the French Navy</b> goes back to the Middle Ages, its history can be said to effectively begin with Richelieu under Louis XIII. </p><p>Since the establishment of her present territory, France had to face three major challenges on the naval level:  </p> <ul><li>Geographically France had two large sections of coastline separated by the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), so she had to keep two naval forces and divide resources between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.</li> <li>Politically and strategically France's main threats came from central Europe which required a strong army rather than a strong navy.</li> <li>Inconsistent support for her navy.  To be effective, navies require infrastructure, ports, dockyards, foundries which must be maintained in peacetime. Officers and crews need plenty of experience at sea. Shortage of resources and political misunderstanding repeatedly damaged the service, creating created a series of brilliant eras followed by disasters.</li></ul><p>The History of the French Navy can be divided into the following eras: </p> <ul><li>The creation of the first actual State Navy, under Louis XIII, thanks to the politics of Richelieu. This navy was largely ruined by the troubles of the Fronde.</li> <li>A rebuilt and brilliant era under Louis XIV, largely thanks to Jean-Baptiste Colbert. The effort was not pursued under the Régence of Philippe d'Orléans and the beginning of the reign of Louis XV; consequently, the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War ended in disaster.</li> <li>A period of rebirth under the impulsion of Choiseul, which culminated under Louis XVI with de Grasse's victory over the British during the American Revolutionary War. In the same period, explorers like Bougainville expanded French geography, naval maps, and founded outposts. The downfall occurred during the French Revolution and the First Empire, leaving the British with a century of undisputed domination of the seas.</li> <li>Under Napoléon III, a modern navy was built, taking advantage of new technologies like steam and ship armour, which made elder fleets effectively obsolete. This force was an important instrument in the constitution and keeping of the French Empire. The fleet maintained a high standard, and between the two world wars (1925–1939), a significant effort was made counter the threat of the German and Italian navies. With the Fall of France, however, most of the Navy never got a chance to fight, and what survived Mers-el-Kebir was eventually annihilated in the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon.</li></ul><p>The French navy is affectionately known as <i>La Royale</i> ("the Royal"). The reason is not well known: it might be for its traditional attachment to the French monarchy; because, before being named "nationale", the Navy had been named "royale" (the navy did not sport the royal titles common with other European navies like the British Royal Navy); or simply because of the location of its headquarters,  "rue Royale" in Paris. </p>

<p><b>"Fort Decker"</b> is a stone house built in 1793 from the remains of the fort of that name.  It is located on West Main Street in Port Jervis, New York, the oldest building in that city, which it predates by several decades. </p><p>The original Fort Decker was built by a Frederick Haynes, a Dutch settler, sometime before 1760, during the French and Indian War, as an unofficial defense and trading post. It was one and a half stories high, built of stone and overlapping logs. Haynes left the area for New Jersey around 1775, leaving the fort to his wife's family, the Deckers.</p><p>On July 19, 1779, during Revolutionary War, when the settlement was known as "Peenpack", the fort was burned during a raid by pro-British Indian leader Joseph Brant. When survivors brought news of the disaster to Goshen, the Patriot attempt to retaliate led to a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Minisink, the only major engagement of the war in the upper Delaware Valley. </p><p>The current house was built from the remains of the fort in 1793. In 1826, it would house engineers working on the Delaware and Hudson Canal, including John Jervis, whom the city would later be renamed for. It remained in private hands as a residence from then on. In 1903, newspapers reported that the original roof was being removed, and in 1924 the building suffered partial damage from a fire.</p><p>As early as the 1880s, there had been interest in using the structure as a museum. This did not become possible until 1970, when the historical society bought it for $1,000 and converted it into a museum. In 1974 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first of three buildings in Port Jervis to attain that distinction, the others being the Erie Depot and the Post Office. </p>

<p><b>Murney Tower</b> is a Martello tower in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, whose construction dates to January of 1846. The Tower was built in response to the Oregon Crisis, which was a tense dispute over the border between British North America and the United States in the 1840s. When the tower was first constructed they planned to call it Murray Tower after the Master General of Ordnance. The land however, was owned by the Murney family and was called Murney Point by the locals. They thus began calling the tower, Murney Tower. This name stuck. The original inscription stone above the door read ‘Murray Tower.’ An ‘N’ was affixed over the first ‘R’ so that the current sign reads ‘MURNAY TOWER’, a hybrid spelling of the two versions. </p><p>The Tower is one of five components of the Kingston Fortifications that defended Kingston Harbour, the Naval Dockyard, military supply depot and the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal. Murney Tower complements the fortifications of Fort Henry, Ontario, Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island, Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada. In addition to protecting the harbour and approaches to Kingston, these fortifications were designed to concentrate fire on Gardiners Island; it being the only place to effectively land artillery at the time.  </p><p>The Tower stands surrounded by a dry-ditch and is accessible only by a bridge. Murney Tower is constructed of limestone with special brickwork on the barracks and basement levels of the Tower's interior. On the thickest side the walls are about 15 ft. thick at the base and 13ft. thick up top. On the weaker side the walls are about 8 ft. thick. The walls are thicker on the south side because a naval attack from the Americans was the most likely form of attack and thus is what the tower is prepared for. Cannonballs from enemy ships should just bounce right off the walls.  </p><p>The Tower was occupied from 1848 until 1885. The main floor (ground level) was the barracks level where the soldiers and their families lived, ate, and slept. It was manned by the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment until 1870, then by Battery A until 1880, and Battery B until 1884. After 1885 it was watched by the PWOR (Prince of Whales Own Rifles). It could house a maximum of 24 soldiers and one officer or multiple soldiers and their families. Currently, the barracks has two internal carronade cannons fired 32-lb cannonballs directed out shuttered windows. These cannons could be moved about the interior embrasures, and so cover multiple approaches, including the bridge. The lower floor contained the ventilated magazine and storage rooms, along with 4 capponieres, which acted as a defense system for the dry-ditch surrounding the Tower, allowing soldiers to fire through small loopholes at troops attacking the Towers base. The uppermost level is the artillery or gun platform, which supports a Blomefield cannon (which also fired 32-lb cannonballs) that could be rotated along an iron track, thus, providing full coverage around the Tower's entire circumference. Roofs are not original Mediterranean design of Martello towers, but a temporary snow roof was later added to the open gun platform two years after the Tower's construction protects the gun and keeps out the large amounts of snow. The addition of a roof is a common feature on Canadian Martellos. In 1921 a windstorm removed the original wooden roof, and the replacement roof does not allow for rapid removal as originally intended. </p><p>Despite being one of the most sophisticated Martello towers designed and built by the British, Murney Tower quickly became obsolete due to improvements made in military weaponry and ship design.  </p><p>Presently, Murney Tower is a National Historic Site, and is also part of the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications World Heritage Site, managed and maintained by the Kingston Historical Society, which operates it as a military museum during the summer months (Victoria Day Weekend in May — Labour Day in September). Displays include three cannons (32-pounder), period uniforms, muskets, and other mid-19th century military artifacts. </p><p>Although 14 Martello towers were built in Canada, only 9 are still standing, 4 of them in Kingston. Currently, only Murney Tower Museum is open to the public. Fort Henry has two towers that resemble Martello towers, however, they are branch ditch towers. </p>

It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows, which cuts through the Cordillera and originates a canyon with tropical mountain climate . </p><p>Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911. </p><p>Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the <i>Intihuatana</i>, the <i>Temple of the Sun</i>, and the <i>Room of the Three Windows</i>. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared. By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues.</p><p>Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.

An Olynthian house took the form of a <i>pastas</i> (a square, two-storey dwelling with rooms giving onto a covered inner courtyard) and was built of river stones and clay, with the superstructure being of unbaked bricks reinforced with a timber framework. In most of the houses, the floor was of compacted earth, but four have mosaic floors made with river pebbles and mortar. </p><p>Photographs and texts describe the domestic organisation (preparation of food, storage of foodstuffs, weaving) and the economic life of the city (stonework, koroplastics, agricultural activities, recreation, symposia). </p><p>Visitors also learn about the course of the excavations, from Robinson's work in 1928 to the excavations of 1990 and 1992. </p>

<p><i><b>The Feast of Saint Nicholas</b></i> (Dutch: <i><b>Het Sint-Nicolaasfeest</b></i>, c. 1665–1668), is a painting by Dutch master Jan Steen, which can now be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It measures 82 x 70.5 cm. The picture, painted in the chaotic Jan Steen "style," depicts a family at home on December 5, the night celebrated in the Netherlands as the Feast of Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas. </p><p>The focal point of the painting is the youngest daughter of the family, a golden-child, painted, in fact, in a golden smock and showing golden locks. She has behaved all year, and Saint Nicholas has rewarded her by stuffing her shoe with a doll and other treats, which she carries in her bucket. She is in stark contrast to her elder brother, standing to her right, who is sobbing, while another brother looks on, laughing. Apparently, the elder brother has been naughty, and his shoe, held up by an elder sister behind him, was left empty. Still there is hope for the sobbing boy. Hidden in the background, almost obscured by the draperies, his grandmother seems to beckon to him—perhaps she is hiding a gift for him too, behind the heavy curtains. While the mother attempts to coax the golden girl to show her the gifts she received, the father, seated in the center of the painting, seems to smile as he remembers his own childhood on this festive night. Further to the right a child can be seen holding a baby and pointing up the chimney, while a younger child looks on in amazement, as he has probably just been told that this was Sinterklaas' method of gaining entry to the house. </p>

After the annexation of Eastern half of the Second Polish Republic by the Soviet Union, main parts of Poland's art collections were transferred from the cities incorporated into the USSR like Lviv. Collections not returned included the Ossolineum holdings which became part of the Lviv National Museum. The cultural heritage shipped in 1946 included Polish and European paintings from 17th to 19th centuries. The 1948 unveiling of the Wrocław Gallery of Polish Painting at a brand new location, composed of national treasures from already disappropriated museums, had a symbolic meaning in the lives of people subjected to mass expulsions from the Eastern Borderlands. The Gallery was arranged to remind them, that they were again residing in Poland.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p>The <b>European Union</b> is a geo-political entity covering a large portion of the European continent. It is founded upon numerous treaties and has undergone expansions that have taken it from 6 member states to 28, a majority of the states in Europe. </p><p>Apart from the ideas of federation, confederation, or customs union, the original development of the European Union was based on a supranational foundation that would "make war unthinkable and materially impossible" and reinforce democracy amongst its members as laid out by Robert Schuman and other leaders in the Schuman Declaration (1950) and the Europe Declaration (1951). This principle was at the heart of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) (1951), the Treaty of Paris (1951), and later the Treaty of Rome (1958) which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC). Both the ECSC and EEC were later incorporated into the European Union while the EAEC maintains a distinct legal identity despite sharing members and institutions. </p><p>The Maastricht Treaty (1992) created the European Union with its pillars system, including foreign and home affairs alongside the European Community. This in turn led to the creation of the single European currency, the euro (launched 1999).

<p><b>John of Antioch</b> was a 7th-century chronicler, who wrote in Greek. He was a monk, apparently contemporary with Emperor Heraclius (610–41). Gelzer (<i>Sextus Julius Africanus</i>, 41) identifies the author with the Monophysite Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch John of the Sedre, who ruled from 630 to 648. </p><p>John of Antioch's chronicle, <i>Historia chronike</i>, is a universal history stretching from Adam to the death of Phocas; it is one of the many adaptations and imitations of the better known chronicle of John Malalas. His sources include Sextus Julius Africanus, Eusebius, and Ammianus Marcellinus. Only fragments remain. </p><p>The fragments of the chronicle are contained in two collections, the Codex Parisinus 1763, which was published in an edition by Claudius Salmasius, and the encyclopedia of history made by order of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912–59), in fifty-three chapters. Of the Constantinian collection only parts remain (Krumbacher, <i>Byzantinische Litteraturgebchichte</i>, 258–60). Two titles: "Of Virtue and Vice" and "Of Conspiracies against Emperors" contain the literary remains of John of Antioch. A difficulty arises from the fact that a great part of the extracts (from the Roman Commonwealth of Justin I) differs considerably from the corresponding quotations in the Salmasian collection. The Constantinian passages are of the nature the old Hellenic writing of history, the Salmasian ones are rather Byzantine and Christian. The Salmasian compilation is older, and so appears to be the original text; the other is no doubt a re-arrangement made under the influence of the Hellenic Renaissance started by  patriarch Photius. But some authorities see in them two different originals and speak of a "Constantinian" and a "Salmasian" John of Antioch. </p><p>The Salmasian excerpts are edited by Cramer, <i>Anecdota Graecae cod. mss. regiae Parisiensis</i>, II, Oxford 1839, 383–401. Both series of fragments are in C. Muller, "Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum", vol. IV, Paris, 1883, 535–622; V, 27–8. </p>

The cylindrical tower is built of limestone and is painted white with a black band.  The limestone used for construction of the lighthouse was obtained from local quarries.  Other materials such as timber and brick were not as accessible and were shipped from Quebec to L’Anse au Loup.  From L’Anse au Loup they were brought to the sight where the lighthouse was constructed, four miles away.  It was built in the series of Imperial Towers and is designated a Provincial Historic Site.

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p><b>Thomas Dempster</b> (23 August 1579 – 6 September 1625) was a Scottish scholar and historian. Born into the aristocracy in Aberdeenshire, which comprises regions of both the Scottish highlands and the Scottish lowlands, he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas' brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the Low Countries and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas' father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery. </p><p>For these and political and religious reasons in these often violent Elizabethan times Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany, who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a <i>magnum opus</i>, the manuscript of <i>De Etruria Regali Libri Septem</i>, "Seven Books about Royal Etruria", in the Latin language, the first detailed study of every aspect of Etruscan civilisation, considered a brilliant work. In 1723 Thomas Coke finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke's library at Holkham. </p>

It became renowned in July 1839 for a slave revolt by Mende captives, who had been enslaved in Sierra Leone, and were being transported from Havana, Cuba to their purchasers' plantations. The African captives took control of the ship, killing some of the crew and ordering the survivors to sail the ship to Africa. The Spanish survivors secretly maneuvered the ship north, and <i>La Amistad</i> was captured off the coast of Long Island by the brig USS <i>Washington</i>. The Mende and <i>La Amistad</i> were interned in Connecticut while federal court proceedings were undertaken for their disposition. The owners of the ship and Spanish government claimed the slaves as property; but the US had banned the African trade and argued that the Mende were legally free. </p><p>Because of issues of ownership and jurisdiction, the case gained international attention. Known as <i>United States v. The Amistad</i> (1841), the case was finally decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of the Mende, restoring their freedom.

<p><b>Erin</b> is a Hiberno-English derivative of the Irish word <i>"Éirinn"</i>. "Éirinn" is the dative case of the Irish word for Ireland - "Éire", genitive "Éireann", the dative being used in prepositional phrases such as <i>"go hÉirinn"</i> "to Ireland", <i>"in Éirinn"</i> "in Ireland", <i>"ó Éirinn</i>" "from Ireland". The dative has replaced the nominative in a few regional Irish dialects (particularly Galway-Connamara and Waterford). Poets and nineteenth-century Irish nationalists used <i>Erin</i> in English as a romantic name for Ireland. Often, "Erin's Isle" was used. In this context, along with Hibernia, Erin is the name given to the female personification of Ireland, but the name was rarely used as a given name, probably because no saints, queens, or literary figures were ever called Erin.</p><p>According to Irish mythology and folklore, the name was originally given to the island by the Milesians after the goddess <i>Ériu</i>. </p><p>Erin go bragh ("Éire go brách" in standard orthography, dative "in Éirinn go brách" "in Ireland for ever"), a slogan dating from the 1798 revolution, is often translated as "Ireland forever". The etymology of the word as it drifted throughout the Gaelic region gave rise to its use by the early Scots to both mean Ireland and "west" - as Ireland lies to the west of Scotland.</p>
<p><i><b>Castor et Pollux</b></i> (<i>Castor and Pollux</i>) is an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, first performed on 24 October 1737 by the Académie royale de musique at its theatre in the Palais-Royal in Paris.

This was the third opera by Rameau and his second in the form of the <i>tragédie en musique</i> (if the lost <i>Samson</i> is discounted). Rameau made substantial cuts, alterations and added new material to the opera for its revival in 1754. Experts still dispute which of the two versions is superior. Whatever the case, <i>Castor et Pollux</i> has always been regarded as one of Rameau's finest works. </p>

<p>The <i><b>Poplars</b></i> series paintings were made by Claude Monet in the summer and fall of 1891. The trees were in a marsh along the banks of the Epte River a few kilometers upstream from Monet's home and studio. To reach his floating painting studio that was moored in place he went by small boat up the nearby waterway to where it joined the mainstream. The trees were along the riverside in single file, following along an S-curve. There were three groups of paintings — in one group the paintings have towering Poplars that go off the top edge of the canvas, in another group there are seven trees, and in another group  three or four Poplars on the banks of the Epte River near Giverny. The trees, which actually belonged to the commune of Limetz, were put up for auction before Monet had completed all of his paintings. At a certain point Monet was forced into buying the trees because he still wasn't finished with his paintings. After he finished the series he sold the trees back to the lumber merchant who wanted them.</p>

The Wexner Center opened in November 1989, named in honor of the father of Limited Brands founder Leslie Wexner, who was a major donor to the Center. </p><p>The Wexner Center is a lab and public gallery, but not a museum, as it does not collect art. However, when the Center was constructed, it replaced the University Gallery of Fine Arts, and assumed possession and stewardship of the University Gallery's permanent collection of roughly 3,000 art works. The collection serves a secondary role in the Center's programs in the visual, media and performing arts. While it is made available to University students and scholars for study, and occasionally drawn upon for exhibitions at the center or elsewhere, it is largely dormant.</p>
<p>The <b>Hollister-Parry House</b> is a historic residence in the village of Woodsfield, Ohio, United States.  Built in the middle of the 19th century, it has been named a historic site and converted into a museum. </p><p>The house is named for two of its most prominent early residents, Nathan Hollister and J.R. Parry, M.D.  Hollister was the house's first resident; one of Monroe County's leading lawyers, he arranged for the house's construction in 1859.  Thirty years later, the property was sold to Parry, a doctor whose family owned it until 1974.</p><p>Built with weatherboarded walls, the two-story house features a small single-story portico over the entrance.  The house's central section is divided into three bays: windows fill the side bays on both stories, while the central bay is occupied by an entrance on the first floor and a larger window on the second.  This section of the house rises to a gable centering on a small fanlight, while the house's brackets and cornice form a pediment at the top of the gable.  A similar portico is placed on the house's western side.  Another distinctive component of the architecture is the weatherboarding: although made of wood, the house's exterior has been shaped to resemble the appearance of ashlar decorated with quoins.  These elements, together with the house's blockish shape, combine to give it the appearance of an Italianate residence with Neo-Renaissance influences.</p><p>Since the days of the Parry family, the house has ceased to be used for residential purposes; it has been converted into a historic house museum, the Parry Museum.  It was also recognized for its historic value in 1980, when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places; it is one of ten National Register-listed locations in Monroe County.  The house qualified for addition to the Register because of its historically significant architecture, as its high-style architecture creates a vast difference between it and the otherwise largely vernacular appearance of Woodsfield's built environment.</p>

<p>The <b>ESSE Purse Museum</b> is a museum located in Little Rock, Arkansas featuring women's handbags, and the day-to-day items carried in them, illustrating the stories of American women's lives during the 1900s. Special topic exhibits are hosted, and the museum has a gift shop.</p><p>The museum originated from the founder's interest in folk art.  In 2006, her personal collection of thousands of handbags was organized into a traveling exhibition that toured the United States through 2011.  Following the tour, the collection was put on display in a historic building in the South Main ("SoMa") district near downtown Little Rock.</p><p>The permanent exhibits showcase handbags that most women owned from the early 1900s through 1999, giving glimpses into their lives. Display cases set up by decade show the styles of purses women carried and their contents, reflecting the events of each decade and illustrating how war, fashion, and economics influenced the style and function of purses.  Special exhibits have included vintage Barbie dolls (2014) and a local artist's series of paintings of women and their purses (2017).</p>
<p>The <i>LCI(L)-713</i>, (a round conn, bow ramp) is located in Portland, Oregon now moored in the Swan Island Lagoon. It is currently owned and being restored by a non-profit 501c3 group, the "Amphibious Forces Memorial Museum".  Built in 1944 in Neponset, Massachusetts, the ship was transferred to the Pacific Theater where it saw action in making two assault landings: Zamboanga, Philippines in March 1945 and Brunei Bay, Borneo in June 1945 (as part of the Battle of North Borneo). Purchased as war surplus initially for use as a log hauling tugboat, the engines were removed and it was relegated to a floating storage hulk in Stevenson, Washington until the late 1950s when it was abandoned and sank into the river mud on the shore of the Columbia River. In the late 1970s the ship was refloated and restoration began on the ship. LCI(L)713 has changed ownership until finally sold to the AFMM in 2003. The LCI(L) 713 has been continually restored with the goal of becoming a historically correct operating museum ship. </p>
<p><i><b>Portrait of Madame Cézanne with Loosened Hair</b></i> (or <i><b>Madame Cézanne with Unbound Hair</b></i>) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Paul Cézanne, variously dated from the mid-1870s to the early 1890s. Although the model, his wife Hortense Fiquet, was not supportive and did not understand or take an interest in her husband's work, this is one of forty-four portraits in which she sat for him from 1869, a period during which she progressed from mistress, to wife, to ex-wife. Something of a socialite, Cézanne latterly found Fiquet often fickle and shallow, and once remarked, "My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade". The sensitivity and depth ascribed to her in this work is likely drawn from his own personality and projected onto her image. </p><p>While elements of the work show the influence of Impressionism, it lacks the characteristic extroverted charm of that movement, and instead focuses on the inner life of the subject. It departs from the artist's earlier portraits of his wife, whom he had earlier divorced, in its sensitivity, delicacy of tone and more relaxed countenance, as seen in the loosened fall of her hair.</p>

<p><b>Philippe-Alexandre Le Brun de Charmettes</b> (1785–1870) was a French historian, poet, translator and official. </p><p>De Charmettes was born in Bordeaux (France). </p><p>He was appointed to the <i>French <i>Conseil d'État</i></i> in 1810 and became a préfet (prefect) in the French department of Haute-Saône in 1830. </p><p>A contributor to the literary magazine <i>l’Abeille littéraire</i>, created by Victor Hugo in 1821, he is mainly known for his successful efforts to rescue  the figure of Jeanne d'Arc from partial oblivion and turn her into a national heroine. </p><p>His interest for Joan came at a time when France was still struggling to define its new identity after the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. The national <i>ethos</i> was in search of non controversial heroes. A staunch prop to King and country, Joan of Arc was an acceptable symbol to the monarchists. As a patriot and the daughter of commoners, she was seen as one prototype of the low-born volunteers (the <i>soldats de l'an II</i>) who had victoriously fought for revolutionary France in 1802 and as such could be claimed by the Republicans. As a religious martyr, she was also popular in the powerful Catholic community. De Charmette's <i>Orleanide</i>, today largely forgotten, was another attempt to magnify the national <i>ethos</i> as writers like Virgil (the Aeneid), or Camoens (the Lusiad) had done for Rome and Portugal. </p>

<p>The <b>Captain Lemuel Clap House</b> (1767) is a historic house located at 199 Boston Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts. It is now owned by the Dorchester Historical Society, which opens the house for tours two afternoons per month.  It is one of two Clapp Houses owned by the society that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. </p><p>It appears that a house has occupied this site since about 1633, and possibly today's house was its enlargement. Although there is no solid evidence for this possibility, the Clapp family genealogy records that such a first house was built circa 1633 by Roger Clapp, one of Dorchester's original settlers in 1630, and then rebuilt and enlarged by his descendant Lemuel Clap in 1767. On the other hand, the Historical Society also has evidence that the earlier house was built by the Ward family at the beginning of the 18th century. </p><p>There seems little doubt, however, that today's house was substantially constructed by Lemuel Clap in 1767.

<p>The <b>Blake Museum</b> is in Bridgwater, Somerset, England and since April 2009 has been run by Bridgwater Town Council with help from The Friends of Blake Museum. It has been an Accredited Museum since 2006.  </p><p>The museum was founded in 1926 by Bridgwater Borough Council, and its collecting area covered from East and West Huntspill in the North to Thurloxton in the South and from Ashcott and Burrowbridge in the East to beyond Nether Stowey in the West. In 1974, the assets of the Borough Council were absorbed by Sedgemoor District Council, which ran the museum until 2009, when it could no longer afford to do so. The Museum was returned to the ownership of the Town Council. Since then, the Museum volunteers have completely re-furbished the building and garden, have undertaken a re-display in new cases of the artefacts, and have begun an update of the museum's catalogue. </p><p>The Museum's 90th birthday in 2016 was celebrated by a special exhibition.</p><p>The building is believed to be the birthplace of Robert Blake, General at Sea (1598–1657). It was built in the late 15th or early 16th century, and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. The three-storey two-bay structure is built of limestone with some hamstone and a mixture of English-bond and Flemish bond brickwork. Some of the ceilings are original including one of six panels divided by chamfered beams and a roundel in the middle of each panel. One of the fireplaces has a Tudor oak lintel.</p><p>Although it is commonly used, Robert Blake's name was never prefixed by "Admiral", which was not used in the Parliamentarian navy; his actual rank of General at Sea combined the role of an Admiral and Commissioner of the Navy. </p><p>Notable features of the museum include artefacts from Blake's life including his sea chest. The museum also illustrates Bridgwater's mercantile and marine past and includes important local historical events such as the Battle of Sedgmoor. As well as a diorama of the Battle of Sedgemoor, the new Battle gallery covers conflicts from the time of King Alfred, the English Civil War as well as the 20th century. The Museum possesses a very full archive of cuttings from the local newspaper, the <i>Bridgwater Mercury</i>, for every week of the war, 1914-1918, which have been used to design a centenary exhibition each August, 2014-2018. </p><p>There is also a small collection of agricultural machinery and tools, and dairy equipment, a group of coins found in the bank of King's Sedgemoor Drain. In 2012, the museum restored and put on display the Spaxton Mosaic. The collection also includes items of women's garments dating from the 19th century, an extensive photographic collection, maritime and transport heritage items, brick, tile and textile items, and a Monmouth rebellion archive. The museum houses the archive of the work of the local artist John Chubb (1746–1818).</p><p>The museum also had an association with Channel 4's archaeological television programme <i>Time Team</i>.</p><p>It works very closely with the Bridgwater Heritage Group, which publishes online much about the town's history. [1] </p><p>The Museum publishes a series of information leaflets about the town's history, which may be downloaded from the museum's website [2] The Museum Friends publishes a quarterly newsletter,<i> Blake News</i>, which features forthcoming exhibitions and talks.

<p><b>Peter the Deacon</b> (French: <i lang="fr">Pierre le Diacre</i>) was the librarian of the abbey of Montecassino and continuator of the <i>Chronicon Monasterii Casinensis</i>, usually called the Montecassino Chronicle in English. The chronicle was originally written by Leo of Ostia. According to both Chalandon and Lord Norwich, Peter is a poor historian and writer, much inferior to Leo.  </p><p>Reputedly a descendant of the Counts of Tusculum, he was offered in 1115 to the monastery of Monte Cassino. About 1127 he was forced to leave the abbey and retired to the neighbouring Atina (Atina, Lazio), because he had supported Abbot Oderisius, who had been deposed by Pope Honorius II.  In 1131 he returned to the abbey owing to the death of Pope Honorius. In 1137, he appeared before Emperor Lothair II, then in Italy, on behalf of his monastery. The sovereign was so pleased with him that he appointed him his chaplain and secretary, and would probably have attached him permanently to his person had not Abbot Wibald considered Peter's return necessary to the abbey.  </p><p>In 1131 on his return to Monte Cassino Peter became librarian and keeper of the abbey archives, of which he compiled a cartulary (Registrum Petri Diaconi). Besides editing the existing chronicle of Monte Cassino (and introducing many falsehoods), he wrote several historical works: "De viris illustribus Casinensibus"; "De ortu et obitu justorum Casinensium"; "De Locis sanctis"; Disciplina Casinensis"; "Rhythmus de novissimis diebus".  </p><p>Peter forged, under the name of Gordian, the <i>Passion of St. Placidus</i>. He is vain and occasionally untruthful, but an entertaining writer. His works are in <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, CLXXIII, 763-1144. </p>
<p><b>Cynthia Herrup</b> is an American historian of early modern British law who holds the position of Professor of History and Law at the University of Southern California.</p><p>Herrup's writings center primarily on the social history of criminal law, but she also touches upon the historical impact of gender and sexuality.  Her first book, <i>The Common Peace: Participation and the Criminal Law in Seventeenth-Century England</i>, examined how communities without lawyers made decisions about law enforcement—it postulated that people as well as lawyers were important in the history of law.  Her second book, <i>A House in Gross Disorder: Sex, Law, and the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven</i> (1999), used a notorious trial to explore how law reflected tensions between genders and generations. </p><p>She has held many fellowships, including those from the Folger Shakespeare Library, the National Humanities Center, and the Huntington Library.</p>
<p>Among several members of the extended Florentine patrician family the Cavalcanti holding the name Giovanni, the chronicler <b>Giovanni Cavalcanti</b> (1381-c.1451), of a minor branch of the family but who was captain of the Guelf party in 1422, is most widely remembered for his malevolent and melancholic account of Florence, covering the period 1420-47. Cavalcanti's <i>Storie</i> obsessively focussed on the city's political intrigues and scandals and was colored by his personal political misfortunes as an aristocratic agitator, first against the corrupt oligarchy of 1420-34 and subsequently of the Medici; his long imprisonment for debt excluded him from the participation in public life that he considered his noble right. </p><p>Historians had discounted the decayed <i>grande</i>, Cavalcanti, who was rehabilitated by Claudio Varese, 1961. In private he was also the author of a <i>Trattato politico-morale</i>, written in the 1440s and dedicated to the anti-Medicean Neri Capponi; it was intended as a Ciceronian moral guide to family morality and a nostalgic account of lost, pre-Medicean civic virtues, offered with Roman parallels, intended for Neri's young son.</p>

<p>This article covers the prehistory &amp; history of Ethiopia, from  emergence as an empire under the Aksumites to its current form as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, as well as the history of other areas in what is now Ethiopia such as the Afar Triangle. The Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia) was first founded by Ethiopian people in the Ethiopian Highlands. Due to migration and imperial expansion, it grew to include many other primarily Afro-Asiatic-speaking communities, including Oromos, Amhara, Somalis, Tigray, Afars, Sidama, Gurage, Agaw and Harari, among others. </p><p>One of the earliest kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of D'mt in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at Yeha. In the first century AD the Aksumite Kingdom rose to power in the Tigray Region with its capital at Aksum and grew into a major power on the Red Sea, subjugating Yemen and Meroe and converting to Christianity in the early fourth century. The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of Islam, forcing the Ethiopians to move south into the highlands for refuge. The Aksumites gave way to the Zagwe Dynasty who established a new capital at Lalibela, before giving way to the Solomonic Dynasty in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that made it dominate the Horn of Africa. Portuguese missionaries arrived at this time. </p><p>In 1529, a conquest of Abyssinia (<i>Futuh al-Habash</i>) by the Ottoman-allied Muslim Adal Sultanate devastated the highlands, and was only deterred by a Portuguese intervention. With both Ethiopia and Adal greatly weakened by the war, the Oromo people were able to invade into the highlands, conquering the remains of the Adal Sultanate and pushing deep into Ethiopia. The Portuguese presence also increased, while the Ottomans began to push into what is now Eritrea, creating the Habesh Eyalet. The Portuguese brought modern weapons and baroque architecture to Ethiopia, and in 1622 converted the emperor Susenyos I to Catholicism, sparking a civil war which ended in his abdication and an expulsion of all Catholics from Ethiopia. A new capital was established at Gondar in 1632, and a period of peace and prosperity ensued until the country was split apart by warlords in the 18th century during the Zemene Mesafint. </p><p>Ethiopia was reunified in 1855 under Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history and his reign was followed by Yohannes IV who was killed in action in 1889. Under Menelik II Ethiopia started its transformation to well organized technological advancement and the structure that the country have now. Ethiopia also expanded to the south and east, through the conquest of the western Oromo (non Shoan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups, resulting in the borders of modern Ethiopia. Ethiopia defeated an Italian invasion in 1896 and came to be recognised as a legitimate state by European powers. A more rapid modernisation took place under Menelik II and Haile Selassie. Italy launched a second invasion in 1935. From October 1935-May 1940, Ethiopia was under Italian military occupation. A joint force of British and Ethiopian rebels managed to drive the Italians out of the country in 1941, and Haile Selassie was returned to the throne. Ethiopia and Eritrea united in a federation, but when Haile Selassie ended the federation in 1961 and made Eritrea a province of Ethiopia, a war for Eritrean independence occurred, lasting until 1991. </p><p>Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974 and the militaristic Derg Regime came to power. In 1977 Somalia invaded, trying to annex the Ogaden region, but were pushed back by Ethiopian, Soviet, and Cuban forces. In 1977 and 1978 the government tortured or killed hundreds of thousands of suspected enemies in the Red Terror. Ethiopia experienced famine in 1984 that killed one million people and civil war that resulted in the fall of the Derg in 1991. This resulted in the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic under Meles Zenawi. Ethiopia remains impoverished, but its economy has become one of the world's fastest growing.</p>

<p><b>Beşparmak Mountains</b> (Latin: Latmus; Ancient Greek: Λάτμος) are a ridge of many spurs located in the Muğla and Aydın provinces of Turkey, running in an east-west direction along the north shore of the former <b>Latmian Gulf</b> on the coast of Caria, which became part of Hellenised Ionia. The city of Latmus, located on the south slopes of Mount Latmus 25 kilometres (16 mi) east of Miletus, was originally a port on the narrow gulf, as reported by Strabo. He also states that Latmus is the same as <b>Mount Phthires</b> in the Catalogue of Trojans.</p><p>The mouth of the Gulf of Latmus began to fill with sediment from the Maeander (Büyük Menderes) river, which emptied into it, even in classical antiquity. By 300 CE Lake Bafa had formed behind the estuary marshes. It gradually diminished in salinity and would now be fresh water except that canals to the Aegean introduce a saline element. The ecology remains a brackish-water one and the lake has been made a bird sanctuary. Its area of 7 square kilometres (2.7 sq mi) with a maximum depth of 25 metres (82 ft) still extends from the base of the west spur of Mount Latmus, although, having lost its port, the ancient medium-sized town of <b>Herakleia</b> (Latmus) has declined in size and facilities to the small village of <b>Kapikiri</b>. </p><p>Beşparmak looms far beyond Kapikiri to the east for a total distance of about 35 kilometres (22 mi), 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) wide. It is deeply eroded by various streams into spurs. The spur that can be seen from Kapikiri is one Dağ, or "mountain", but the entire ridge with all the spurs is Dağlar, "mountains", in the sense of "range." The ancient writers generally recognized the western spur over the gulf as Latmus, but Strabo reports that the ridge east was called <b>Mount Grium</b> and extended through Caria.</p>

<p>Founded in 1975, the <b>Art Gallery of the Society for Macedonian Studies</b> is a museum in Thessaloniki, Greece. It was the first organised visual art institution in the city of Thessaloniki, its purpose being to promote and disseminate modern Greek art, mainly that of northern Greece. It occupies the top floor of the building that also houses the State Theatre of Northern Greece. The building was designed by the architect Vassilis Kassandras and stands directly opposite the White Tower on the sea-front. </p><p>The collection comprises more than 400 works, mainly paintings, sculptures and engravings, mostly by artists from Thessaloniki and Macedonia in general, though there are also works by major artists from the rest of Greece and other countries. Works by foreign artists are selected by virtue of their connection with the city, i.e. they depict monuments or landscapes of Thessaloniki. Most of the artwork has been donated, some purchased, and at one time quite a number of works were bequeathed to the gallery. Early in 1999, it was augmented by works from the Papanakos Collection. </p><p>There is space to display only 150 works, yet the exhibition presents an entirely satisfactory picture of the basic orientations of visual expression in northern Greece, as also of the development of modern Greek art since 1850.

<p><b>Joshua Scottow</b> (England, ca. 1618 - Boston, Massachusetts, USA, January 20, 1698), was a colonial American merchant and the author of two histories of early New England: <i>Old Men's Tears for Their Own Declensions</i> (1691) and <i>A Narrative of the Planting of the Massachusetts Colony Anno 1628</i> (1694).  </p><p>Scottow emigrated to Massachusetts between 1630 and 1634 with his widowed mother Thomasina and older brother Thomas. He settled in Boston and was admitted to membership in the Old (South) Church in 1639. He married Lydia (surname unknown) in 1640, and they had seven children. He acquired considerable wealth trading with Acadia, dealing in waterfront property, and developing frontier settlements near Scarborough, Maine. In November 1658, William Crowne, proprietor of Nova Scotia, leased a portion of the colony to Scottow and Captain George Curwin (grandfather of Salem Witch Trials high sheriff George Corwin). He served as a captain in King Philip's War alongside pardoned pirate Peter Roderigo. He was survived by his wife and four children, three daughters and a son Thomas, who graduated from Harvard College in 1677. </p><p>Scottow was a devout supporter of the Massachusetts theocracy. His two histories are examples of a rhetorical form popular in Puritan New England known as the jeremiad, the importance of which was demonstrated by Perry Miller and again, with different emphasis, by Sacvan Bercovitch. Miller’s famous “declension thesis” derives its name from Scottow’s title. Both histories declare that the founding generation of New England was “animated as with one soul” for the achievement of a millennial religious mission and that the present (1690s) generation has lost its focus and loyalties. Scottow’s language is replete with biblical and classical references; and he applies the biblical signs and figures to demonstrate New England’s providential destiny, while at the same time lamenting the woeful present state of a society confounded by internal “declension” and threatened by Indians, Quakers, witches, imperial officials, and the French.  Scottow’s Christian typology and typological exegesis are used to resolve the apparent contradictions between New England’s current fallen state and both its “original” mission and its guaranteed millennial destiny. </p><p>Nine months after the execution of Ann Hibbins, who was convicted of practicing witchcraft, Scottow, a selectman at the time, apologized to the General Court for his support of her.  "He stated that he did not intend to oppose the proceedings of the General Court in the case of Mrs. Ann Hibbins: " I am cordially sorry that anything from me, either in word or writing, should give offence to the honored Court, my dear brethren in the church, or any others."</p>

<p>The <b>Errea House</b> is a historic house located at 311 S. Green St. in Tehachapi, California. The house is the only surviving building from the settlement of Tehichipa, the first town in the Tehachapi area. Tehichipa was founded in 1869, and the house was built sometime between 1870 and 1875. In 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad bypassed Tehichipa, instead establishing a new townsite at Tehachapi Summit, which later became Tehachapi. The railroad led to the decline of Tehichipa's shipping industry, and the town's residents gradually moved to Tehachapi. The Errea House was moved to Tehachapi as well around 1900. No buildings from the original settlement survive at the site of Tehichipa, and the Errea House is the only building remaining from the town. The Errea House is now located across from the Tehachapi Museum, where it helps illustrate the city's early history.</p><p>The Errea House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 29, 1997.</p>

<p>The <b>Muscarelle Museum of Art</b> is a university museum affiliated with The College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia. While the Museum only dates to 1983, the College art collection has been in existence since its first gift – a portrait of the physicist Robert Boyle – in 1732. Most early gifts to the College relate to its history or the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Gifts of portraiture were the foundation of the early collection and include many First Families of Virginia (FFV) including sitters from the Page, Bolling and Randolph families.</p><p>Throughout the years, gifts of art continued to accumulate including a donation of <i>White Flower</i> by Georgia O'Keeffe given to the College in the 1930s by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. This major work in the collection had indiscriminately "decorated" various campus walls, old and new, until it was re-discovered by President Thomas Ashley Graves Jr. in the 1970s. Graves tasked Dr. Miles Chappell, from the department of art and art history, to make a college-wide inventory. It was at that time that the immensity and importance of the growing collection was understood and the need for a university museum became apparent. </p><p>With the support of numerous alumni, including a major benefactor, Joseph L. Muscarelle (W&amp;M '27) and his wife Margaret, the Muscarelle Museum of Art opened in 1983 with Dr. Glenn D. Lowry as director. In 1987, the second director, Mark Johnson oversaw the expansion of the facility and the first American Alliance of Museums accreditation in 1988. Subsequent accreditations came in 2000 under Dr. Bonnie Kelm and in 2012 under the present director, Dr. Aaron H. De Groft. </p><p>Today the collection numbers over 5,000 works. Of particular note are Colonial American and English seventeenth and eighteenth century portraits; a survey collection of original prints and drawings from the fifteenth through the twenty-first centuries including Japanese prints and a major collection of German Expressionist works by Hans Grohs; and the Jean Outland Chrysler collection of American modern works interpreted in oils, drawings, watercolors, and sculpture. Recent acquisitions include European master works by such artists as Agnolo Bronzino, Luca Giordano, Guido Reni, Luca Forte, Annibale Carracci and Peter Paul Rubens among others. </p><p>As of May 2018, the galleries are temporarily closed while a new facility for the Muscarelle Museum of Art is developed. The Muscarelle will expand significantly as it becomes part of a new, multi-million dollar, state-of-the-art building that will be known as The Martha Wren Briggs Center for the Visual Arts designed by César Pelli of Pelli Clarke Pelli. The new facility will expand gallery space for both traveling exhibitions and the permanent collection as well as create additional space for storage, lectures, events, and programming.</p>
<p><b>Gayle Dean Wardlow</b> (born August 31, 1940) is an American historian of the blues. He is particularly associated with research into the lives of the musicians Charlie Patton and Robert Johnson and the historical development of the Delta blues, on which he is a leading authority. </p><p>He was born in Freer, Texas, but was brought up from the age of six in Meridian, Mississippi. In his teens he began collecting Roy Acuff 78s. He originally began collecting blues records so as to exchange them for Acuff's.  However, by about 1960 he had started collecting blues records for their own sake, and realised that very little biographical information existed on the musicians who had created them.</p><p>By 1963, Wardlow had begun researching a book on Delta blues musicians, mainly by making enquiries in black neighbourhoods, recording oral histories, anecdotes, songs, and remembrances. He interviewed Ishman Bracey, Charlie Patton's widow, and blues talent broker H. C. Speir, and a few years later uncovered Robert Johnson's death certificate. Hayes McMullan's musical talents were unearthed following a chance encounter in 1967 between Wardlow and McMullan. Wardlow transcribed the songs and penned the sleevenotes for the 2017 CD release of McMullan's <i>Everyday Seem Like Murder Here</i>, issued over 30 years after McMullan's death. In the process of his overall research work, Wardlow became a leading authority on country blues. He also amassed the world’s largest and most valuable collection of pre-war blues records, many of which are now unique. </p><p>Wardlow has published many articles on blues history and the book <i>Chasin' That Devil Music: Searching for the Blues</i>, which was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2006 as a classic of blues literature.   </p><p>He has worked as an investigative and sports journalist, serving as sports information director at Livingston University and the University of Alabama. He has also been a journalism professor at various universities. </p>

<p>The <i><b>Moreel Triptych</b></i> (or the <i><b>Saint Christopher Altarpiece</b></i>) is the name given to a 1484 panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Hans Memling (d. 1494). It was commissioned by the donors, the prominent Bruges politician, merchant and banker Willem Moreel (d. 1501) and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, née van Hertsvelde (d. 1499). It was intended as their epitaph at the chapel of the St. James's Church, Bruges, an extension they paid for, to the funerary church of Willem's family, where the couple intended to be interred in an underground tomb before the altar. </p><p>The inner center panel of the triptych altarpiece show Saint Christopher holding the Christ Child, with Saint Maurus to his left and Saint Gills to his right. Willem Moreel kneels in prayer and venerating the saints in the left-hand panel with their five sons. Barbara kneels with eleven of their daughters on the right panel. The exterior panels are probably an early 16th-century addition, completed after the donor's and artist's deaths. </p><p>The triptych was installed on the altar of St. James's Church in 1484. It is in its original frames, which are each inscribed with the words <i>anno Domini 1484</i>, or a variant containing the year, on their lower borders. The altarpiece has a strong association with the Benedictine order; three of the figures are Benedictine monks or saints. It is to dedicated to Saint Maurus and St Giles, the latter a Benedictine hermit. Today the work is located in the Groeningemuseum in Bruges. </p>

<p><b>Ṭūbā</b> (Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">طُـوْبَىٰ</span>‎, <small>lit. </small>'blessedness') is a term often associated with a tree that some Muslims believe grows in <i>Al-Jannah</i> (Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ٱلْـجَـنَّـة</span>‎, the Islamic Heaven). </p><p>The term is only mentioned once in the Koran in the context of blessedness and it is not mentioned as a Tree by name. The only other source that relates the arguably same term to a tree is a hadith. The term has caught the imagination of writers over the years. For example, Sohrevardi developed a story surrounding the old Persian mythology and suggests that it is indeed a Tree in the heaven where the mythical bird Simurgh lay eggs. Similarly, in 1449, Mehmed Yazıcıoğlu wrote of a similar tree in <i>The Creation of Paradise</i> in his manuscript called <i>Muhammediye</i>:</p> <blockquote class="templatequote"><p>In its courtyard's riven center, planted he the Tuba-Tree; </p><p>That a tree which hangeth downward, high aloft its roots are there: Thus its radiance all the Heavens lighteth up from end to end, Flooding every tent and palace, every lane and every square. Such a tree the Tuba, that the Gracious One hath in its sap Hidden whatsoe'er there be of gifts and presents good and fair; Forth therefrom crowns, thrones, and jewels, yea, and steeds and coursers come, Golden leaves and clearest crystals, wines most pure beyond compare. For his sake there into being hath he called the Tuba-Tree, That from Ebu-Qasim's hand might every one receive his share. </p> </blockquote> <p>According to Islamic tradition, when the wife of the Prophet asked him the reason of kissing his daughter a lot. He replied that during Ascension, I ate the fruits of Tuba and when I returned I became intimate with my wife and Fatimah was born. So, whenever I kiss Fatimah I smell the fragrance of that tree of Paradise.  The holy city of Touba, Senegal, is named for the tree. </p><p>The Arabic female given name Tuba or Touba derives from the tree.  Tuba (often spelt "Tuğba") is also a modern Arabic borrowing into Turkish and has become a common female name since the 1970s.</p>

<p>The <b>Coat of arms of Grimstad</b> usually has a shield form typical of the early period of modern Norwegian heraldry. The shield is blue (PMS299) and the motive is a gold (PMS 871) brig sailing towards the heraldic right on three gold waves. The particular sails the ship is carrying is also specified. Atop the shield sits a gold mural crown with four towers. The four towers symbolise the four former municipalities joined to form the present Grimstad municipality: Grimstad, Eide, Landvik and Fjære. </p><p>The coat of arms is based on a local official seal preserved from 1839, but probably from 1816 when Grimstad received city privileges. The coat of arms was first presented in 1899 by Reidar Haavin. His design was used until 1985. From 1984 Kjell Westermark Mørch revised the design to get it as close to the strict heraldic rules of Norwegian municipal heraldry without removing the features deemed typical of Grimstad. However, due to the use of two charges the coat of arms did not receive Royal approval. The design was still approved by the Grimstad city council on 25 March 1985. </p>
<p><b>Aidos</b> (Greek: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Αἰδώς</span>, <small>pronounced </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ai̯dɔ̌ːs]</span>) was the Greek goddess of shame, modesty, respect, and humility.

<p>The <b>International Friendship Exhibition</b> is a large museum complex located at Myohyangsan, North Pyongan Province, North Korea. It is a collection of halls that house gifts presented to former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il from various foreign dignitaries. The protocol of gift-giving is well established in Korean culture.</p><p>Built in a traditional style, the halls opened on 26 August 1978 and consist of over 150 rooms covering a total area of between 28,000 and 70,000 square metres. The building offers the impression that it has windows, though it has none. According to a local legend, Kim Jong-il built the International Friendship Exhibition in three days; however, actual construction took a year. Currently, estimates of how many gifts the exhibition holds vary between 60,000 and 220,000 gifts. On entering the exhibition, shoes must be removed and visitors are asked to bow before portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Satellite imagery from 2017 shows increased underground activity at the site, suggesting an expansion may be underway.</p><p>The setting of the museum in the Myohyang mountains, near the Pohyon temple, was the subject of a poem by Kim Il-sung, which he later chanted from the balcony of the International Friendship Exhibition on October 15, 1979:</p> <blockquote><p>"On the balcony I see the most<br></p><p>glorious scene in the world...<br> The Exhibition stands here,<br> its green eaves upturned, to exalt<br> The dignity of the nation,<br></p><p> and Piro Peak looks higher still."</p></blockquote> <p>The museum is said to act as propaganda, giving the impression of worldwide support for the North Korean government. Visitors to the museum are informed that the number of gifts constitute "proof of the endless love and respect toward the Great Leader [Kim Il-sung]". However, North Korean visitors to the site are unaware of the ceremonial exchange of gifts in diplomatic protocol, and are described by Helen-Louise Hunter to be "impressed by the self-serving explanations offered to them". Another author, Byoung-lo Philo Kim, states that the entire exhibition is "aimed at convincing [North] Korean visitors that their leaders are universally admired".</p>

<p><b>Angitia</b> was a goddess among the Marsi, the Paeligni and other Oscan-Umbrian peoples of central Italy. She was associated in antiquity with snake-charmers who claimed her as their ancestor. Roman interpretations probably obscure her Marsian significance.</p><p>Angitia's myths vary. According to Gnaeus Gellius (late 2nd century BC), Angitia was one of the three daughters of Aeëtes, along with Medea and Circe, two of the most famed sorceresses of Greek myth. Circe, as widely known from the <i>Odyssey</i>, practiced transforming spells; Medea ended up in Italy, where her son ruled over the Marsi. Angitia lived in the area around the Fucine lake and specialized in curing snake bites.</p><p>Angitia is attested by inscriptions in the territory of the Marsi and elsewhere in the Central Apennines. She is named in three inscriptions from Luco dei Marsi, in antiquity known as <i>Lucus Angitiae</i>, "Sacred Grove of Angitia." The earliest is a dedication to the goddess "on behalf of the Marsic legions," dating to the late 4th century BC. The name also appears on a dedicatory cippus from Civita d'Antino, in the Umbrian Iguvine Tablets, and in inscriptions in the territories of the Paeligni, Vestini, and Sabines. She is mentioned along with Angerona in one inscription, and in another her name appears in the plural. Another indicates that she had a temple and a treasury. The Romans derived her name from <i>anguis</i>, "serpent," hence the form <i>Anguitia</i>.</p><p>As snakes were often associated with the healing arts in antiquity (see, for instance, rod of Asclepius), Angitia is believed to have been mainly a goddess of healing.  She had powers of witchcraft, magic and medicine being regarded as complementary in the ancient world, and was a master in the art of miraculous and herbal healing, especially when it came to snakebites. She was also attributed with a wide range of powers over snakes, including the power to kill snakes with a touch. </p><p>According to the account given by Servius, Angitia was of Greek origin, for Arigitia was the name given by the Marrubians to Medea, who after having left Colchis came to Italy with Jason and taught the people the above-mentioned remedies. Silius Italicus identifies her as Medea. </p>
<p><b>6 Hebe</b> (<span></span> <i title="English pronunciation respelling"><span>HEE</span>-bee</i>) is a large main-belt asteroid, containing around half a percent of the mass of the belt.

This high bulk density suggests an extremely solid body that has not been impacted by collisions, which is not typical of asteroids of its size – they tend to be loosely-bound rubble piles. </p><p>In brightness, Hebe is the fifth-brightest object in the asteroid belt after Vesta, Ceres, Iris, and Pallas.

<p>There are many references to ravens in the world through legends and literature. Most of these refer to the widespread common raven. Because of its black plumage, croaking call, and diet of carrion, the raven has long been considered a bird of ill omen. </p><p>French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss proposed a structuralist theory that suggests the raven (like the coyote) obtained mythic status because it was a mediator animal between life and death. As a carrion bird, ravens became associated with the dead and with lost souls. In Swedish folklore, they are the ghosts of murdered people without Christian burials and, in German stories, damned souls.</p>

<p>The <b>Parabiago plate</b>, also known as the <b>Parabiago patera</b>, is an ancient Roman circular silver plate depicting mythological figures. It was found in an ancient Roman cemetery at Parabiago, near Milan, in 1907. The plate depicts Cybele with her consort Attis in a "vast cosmic setting" amid "sun, moon, earth and sea, time and the seasons." At the time of its discovery, it was thought to have been used as a lid for a funerary amphora.</p><p>The plate is difficult to date. Earlier scholars tended to date it to the 2nd century AD, because of its classicizing style, but stylistic characteristics also permit a later date. Technical analyses, however, support a provenance in the 4th–5th centuries, even though it bears little stylistic resemblance to other silver pieces from that period.</p>
<p><b>Christian Jürgensen Thomsen</b> (29 December 1788 – 21 May 1865) was a Danish antiquarian who developed early archaeological techniques and methods. </p><p>In 1816 he was appointed head of 'antiquarian' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity.  </p><p>Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen's study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from "closed finds", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the <i>Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed</i> (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836. An English translation was produced in 1848. </p>

<p>The <b>history of Hawaii</b> describes the era of human settlements in the Hawaiian Islands. That history begins sometime between 124 and 1120 CE, when the islands were first settled by Polynesians. Hawaiian civilization was isolated from the rest of the world for at least 500 years. </p><p>Europeans led by British explorer James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Within five years, European military technology helped Kamehameha I conquer and unify the islands for the first time, establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii. The kingdom was prosperous and important for its agriculture and strategic location in the Pacific.  </p><p>American immigration began almost immediately after European contact, led by Protestant missionaries. Americans set up plantations to grow sugar. Their methods of plantation farming required substantial labor. Waves of permanent immigrants came from Japan, China and the Philippines to work in the fields. The government of Japan organized and gave special protection to its people, who comprised about 25 percent of the Hawaiian population by 1896.</p><p>The native population succumbed to disease brought by the Europeans (particularly smallpox), declining from 300,000 in the 1770s over 60,000 in the 1850s to 24,000 in 1920. Americans within the kingdom government rewrote the constitution, severely curtailing the power of King "David" Kalākaua, and disenfranchising the rights of most Native Hawaiians and Asian citizens to vote, through excessively high property and income requirements. This gave a sizeable advantage to plantation owners. Queen Liliuokalani attempted to restore royal powers in 1893, but was placed under house arrest by businessmen with help from the US military. Against the Queen's wishes, the Republic of Hawaii was formed for a short time. This government agreed on behalf of Hawaii to join the US in 1898 as the Territory of Hawaii. In 1959, the islands became the state of Hawaii of the United States. </p>

<p>In Hungarian mythology, <b>Prince Csaba</b> was the youngest son of Attila, King of the Huns. A fierce and skilled warrior, he led the Huns to victory in all the battles they encountered over the ages.  </p><p>But after Csaba's death, the Huns had no one to take his place. Seizing their chance, the enemies of the Huns launched an assault on the Hun kingdom. As they met on the field of battle, the enemy generals mocked the Huns, saying "and who will save you now that Csaba is gone?" But no sooner had those words been spoken, a bright pathway consisting of stars appeared in the night sky and Csaba rode down at the head of an army from the heavens. Csaba and his army routed the Frankish invaders and saved the Huns once again, and three more times he returned down the "Skyway of the Warriors" to defend his people, and according to some versions of the legend, he was seen once more several centuries later leading Árpád and the Hungarians, brother tribe of the Huns, over the Carpathians and into the land that is today known as Hungary. </p><p>Consequently, the meaning of the Hungarian name Csaba (Csaba - "A gift from the sky" or "A gift from the heavens") is said to have been derived from this legend. </p>

<p>In Welsh mythology, <b>Gwythyr ap Greidawl</b> was a rival of Gwyn ap Nudd, a deity connected with the otherworld. In the Middle Welsh prose tale <i>Culhwch ac Olwen</i>, he is named as a member of Arthur's retinue and takes part in the quest to win the hand of Olwen for Arthur's cousin, Culhwch. Gwthyr would join Arthur on a journey to Pennant Gofid in Hell to retrieve the blood of the witch Orddu. His father is Greidawl Galldonyd, a fellow knight in Arthur's court. In <i>Bonedd yr Arwyr</i>, his genealogy is given as Gwythyr son of Greidawl the son of Enfael the son of Deigyr the son of Dyfnwal the son of Ednyfed the son of Maxen the son of Llywelyn. The Welsh Triads name him as the father of Arthur's second wife, also named   Gwenhwyfar.</p><p>Sometime before the main events of <i>Culhwch and Olwen</i>, Gwythyr was engaged to marry Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd, who was stolen from him by her brother, Gwyn ap Nudd. In a violent battle, Gwyn defeated his rival, kept Creiddylad and took a number of Gwythyr's chieftains prisoner. When Arthur heard of this, he forced Gwyn to release the noblemen and made peace between the two adversaries. </p><p>Every Calan Mai, the two would fight over Creiddylad, until a battle on Judgment Day, in which the victor would keep her forever. Their rivalry has been taken to represent the contest between summer and winter and is a variant of the Holly King myth.</p>

He graduated from the Warsaw University and completed his PhD thesis in 2008. He is the recipient of the United States Holocaust Museum Fellowship. He specializes in World War II history of Poland with a special focus on Polish-Jewish relations and the rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust. He runs an internet portal called <i>Życie za Życie</i> (Life for a Life) with educational and audio-visual materials as well as online documentaries devoted to the subject. The portal was inaugurated in March 2011 under the auspices of IPN and the National Centre of Culture represented by Anna Chylak.</p><p>He is the author of Holocaust biography titled <i>Adam Czerniaków 1880-1942</i>, about the Warsaw Ghetto leader who committed suicide when ordered by Nazi Germans to participate in the selection of Jews to Treblinka during the Grossaktion Warsaw of 1942.

<p><b>The Jesse James Home Museum</b> is the house in St. Joseph, Missouri where outlaw Jesse James was living and was gunned down on April 3, 1882, by Robert Ford.  It is a one-story, Greek Revival style frame dwelling measuring 24 feet, 2 inches, wide and 30 feet, 4 inches, deep.</p><p>At the time, the house was located at 1318 Lafayette Street in St. Joseph. In 1939, it was moved to a busier Belt Highway location. In 1977, it was moved to a location directly behind Patee House at 12th and Mitchell in St. Joseph, only two blocks away from its original location, which restored more of its historic context. </p><p>The investigation into the shooting death of James was conducted at Patee House Hotel (formerly the World's Hotel).  Mrs. James, her two children, and Jesse's mother stayed in Patee House for two nights after Jesse James was killed. </p><p>The house has a large bullet hole on the north interior wall.  The hole was actually much smaller but over the years, souvenir hunters carved shavings from the hole and enlarged it. </p>  <p>The Jesse James Home contains a number of items owned by Jesse James and his family.  In 1995, top forensic scientist Professor James E. Starrs, of George Washington University, conducted an exhumation of the grave of Jesse James to settle persistent controversy about the remains. In February 1996, he announced that DNA tests performed on the remains and compared to the DNA of existing known relatives proved a 99.7% reliability that the body in the grave was that of Jesse James.  The museum includes new exhibits based on the 1995 exhumation, including artifacts such as coffin handles, bits of wood, and a pin Jesse James wore in his death photo, as well as numerous photos taken during the exhumation. </p><p>The home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1980.

<p>The <b>anchored cross</b>, or mariner's cross, is a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor. It is a symbol which is shaped like a plus sign with anchor-like protrusions at the end of each arm, hence the name.

<p><b>Wadj-wer</b> is an Egyptian god of fertility whose name means the "Great Green".</p><p>It was commonly believed that Wadj-wer was a personification of the Mediterranean Sea; however, it is apparently more likely that he rather represented the lagoons and lakes in the northernmost Nile Delta, as suggested by some texts describing the "great green" as dry lands which could be crossed by foot, possibly a mention of the edge between two or more lakes.</p><p>The earliest known attestation of Wadj-wer is dated back to the 5th Dynasty, in the mortuary temple of the pyramid of Sahure, at Abusir; here, he appears similar to the god Hapi, but with his body filled by water ripples. He also appears on the walls of the much later (20th Dynasty) tomb QV55 of prince Amunherkhepeshef, son of pharaoh Ramesses III.</p>

<p>The <b>Exchequer Standards</b> may refer to the set of official English standards for weights and measures created by Queen Elizabeth I (English units), and in effect from 1588 to 1826, when the Imperial Units system took effect, or to the whole range of English unit standards maintained by the Court of the Exchequer from the 1200s, or to the physical reference standards physically kept at the Exchequer and used as the legal reference until the such responsibility was transferred in the 1860s, after the Imperial system had been established.</p><p>The Exchequer standards made in the reign of Queen Elizabeth were not authorized by any statute. The standards were ordered by the royal authority, as appears from a roll of Michaelas terms in the 29th Elizabeth, preserved in the Queen's Remembrancer's Office, and containing the royal proclamation.</p><p>The Exchequer Standards were so called because their repository had always been the Court of the King's Exchequer.</p><p>Notably, Elizabeth I's redefinition of these standards instituted the English Doubling System, whereby each larger liquid measure equals exactly two of the next-smaller measure. </p>

<p>The <b>sea-level curve</b> is the representation of the changes of the sea level throughout the geological history. </p><p>The first such curve is the <b>Vail curve</b> or <b>Exxon curve</b>. The names of the curve refer to the fact that in 1977 a team of Exxon geologists from Esso Production Research headed by Peter Vail published a monograph on global eustatic sea-level changes. Their sea-level curve was based on seismic and biostratigraphic data accumulated during petroleum exploration.</p><p>The Vail curve (and the monograph itself) was the subject of debate among geologists, because it was based on undisclosed commercially confidential stratigraphic data, and hence not independently verifiable.

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The <b>Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</b>, formally the <b>Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania</b>, after 1791 the <b>Commonwealth of Poland</b>, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of the 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its largest territorial extent, in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned almost 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million.</p><p>The Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been in a <i>de facto</i> personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King <i>jure uxoris</i> Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the state's size and the Commonwealth collapsed as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. </p><p>The Union possessed many features unique among contemporary states. Its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power. These checks were enacted by a legislature (<i>sejm</i>) controlled by the nobility (<i>szlachta</i>). This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy, constitutional monarchy, and federation. Although the two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal, Poland was the dominant partner in the union.</p><p>The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance, guaranteed by the Warsaw Confederation Act 1573; however, the degree of religious freedom varied over time. The Constitution of 1791 acknowledged Catholicism as the "dominant religion," unlike the Warsaw Confederation, but freedom of religion was still granted with it.</p><p>After several decades of prosperity, it entered a period of protracted political, military and economic decline. Its growing weakness led to its partitioning among its neighbors (Austria, Prussia and the Russian Empire) during the late 18th century. Shortly before its demise, the Commonwealth adopted a massive reform effort and enacted the May 3 Constitution—the first codified constitution in modern European history and the second in modern world history (after the United States Constitution).</p>
<p><b>Horme</b> (Ancient Greek: <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Ὁρμή</span>) is the Greek spirit personifying energetic activity, impulse or effort (to do a thing), eagerness, setting oneself in motion, and starting an action, and particularly onrush in battle. She had an altar at Athens, where mainly the divine servants and relations of Zeus (including Pheme and Aidos, as well as Athena) had altars. Her opposite character is Aergia, a goddess of sloth and apathy. The word "horme" is also used to refer to the philosophical concept represented by the goddess.</p><p>The name 'horme' was adopted by Sir Percy Nunn to refer to all the purposive behaviours (drives or urges) of an organism - whether conscious or not.  He based this on a suggestion by Jung but saw it as having a wider significance than Jung's idea of relating the term to psychological values.   Montessori made this a central point of her later thinking, stressing that the behaviour of the child was driven by an inner urge to self construct, to become the adult they were destined to be. This idea of the future drawing the child on (as opposed to child development being just driven by causality) was related to the Aristotelian concept of entelechy which would have formed an implicit part of her Thomist education as a devout Catholic.   The concept, but not the name, has been developed by writers such as James Hillman where he applies the idea to adults and refers to it as 'destiny' or the individual's daemon.  </p>

Shortly after his 16th birthday, he suffered severe battle injuries.  Five months later he was imprisoned for his part in the Uprising.  These early experiences may have precipitated the panic disorder and agoraphobia that would dog him through life, and shaped his opposition to attempting to regain Poland's independence by force of arms. </p><p>In 1872 at age 25, in Warsaw, he settled into a 40-year journalistic career that highlighted science, technology, education, and economic and cultural development.  These societal enterprises were essential to the endurance of a people who had in the 18th century been partitioned out of political existence by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Głowacki took his pen name "<i>Prus</i>" from the appellation of his family's coat-of-arms. </p><p>As a sideline he wrote short stories.  Succeeding with these, he went on to employ a larger canvas; over the decade between 1884 and 1895, he completed four major novels: <i>The Outpost</i>, <i>The Doll</i>, <i>The New Woman</i> and <i>Pharaoh</i>.  <i>The Doll</i> depicts the romantic infatuation of a man of action who is frustrated by his country's backwardness.  <i>Pharaoh</i>, Prus' only historical novel, is a study of political power and of the fates of nations, set in ancient Egypt at the fall of the 20th Dynasty and New Kingdom. </p>

<p>Zionism as an organized movement is generally considered to have been founded by Theodor Herzl in 1897. However, the <b>history of Zionism</b> began earlier and is related to Judaism and Jewish history. The Hovevei Zion, or the <i>Lovers of Zion</i>, were responsible for the creation of 20 new Jewish settlements in Palestine between 1870 and 1897.</p><p>Before the Holocaust, the movement's central aims were the creation of a Jewish national home and cultural centre in Palestine by facilitating Jewish migration. After the Holocaust, the movement focused on creation of a Jewish state (usually defined as a secular state with a Jewish majority), attaining its goal in 1948 with the creation of Israel. </p><p>Since the creation of Israel, the importance of the Zionist movement as an organization has declined, as the Israeli state has grown stronger.</p><p>The Zionist movement continues to exist, working to support Israel, assist persecuted Jews and encourage Jewish emigration to Israel. While most Israeli political parties continue to define themselves as Zionist, modern Israeli political thought is no longer formulated within the Zionist movement. </p><p>The success of Zionism has meant that the percentage of the world's Jewish population who live in Israel has steadily grown over the years and today 40% of the world's Jews live in Israel. There is no other example in human history of a nation being reestablished after such a long period of existence as a diaspora.</p>

<p>The <b>Book of Gates</b> is an Ancient Egyptian funerary text dating from the New Kingdom. It narrates the passage of a newly deceased soul into the next world, corresponding to the journey of the sun through the underworld during the hours of the night. The soul is required to pass through a series of 'gates' at different stages in the journey. Each gate is associated with a different goddess, and requires that the deceased recognise the particular character of that deity. The text implies that some people will pass through unharmed, but that others will suffer torment in a lake of fire. </p>

<p><b>Timothy Alan Reuter</b> (25 January 1947 – 14 October 2002), grandson of the former mayor of Berlin Ernst Reuter, was a German-British historian who specialized in the study of medieval Germany, particularly the social, military and ecclesiastical institutions of the Ottonian and Salian periods (10th–12th centuries). </p><p>Reuter received his D.Phil. from Oxford in medieval history under the supervision of Karl Leyser (d. 1992), another leading Anglophone scholar of German history. After a brief stint lecturing at the University of Exeter, Reuter spent more than a decade as a <i>Mitarbeiter</i> (academic staff member) at the Monumenta Germaniae Historica in Munich, where he worked on editing the letters of the twelfth-century abbot Wibald of Corvey and (with Dr. Gabriel Silagi) produced an important electronic database that served as the basis for a concordance to the work of the medieval canonist Gratian. </p><p>In 1994, Reuter was appointed to a professorship at the University of Southampton, where he remained until his death in 2002. At Southampton, he spearheaded a number of educational and research initiatives that promoted medieval history and scholarship. </p><p>In addition to his careful and insightful research, pioneering work on computer-assisted text editing methods and professional contributions to the historical academy in the UK and Germany, Reuter served as an important liaison between the worlds of Anglo-American and German medieval studies. Among his important contributions in this area were numerous book reviews in German and British publications, a highly regarded translation of Gerd Tellenbach's monograph on the history of the church in the High Middle Ages (<i>The Church in Western Europe from the tenth to the early twelfth century,</i> Cambridge, 1993) and the posthumous editing and publishing of his mentor Karl Leyser's papers (<i>Communications and Power in Medieval Europe,</i> 2 vols., Hambledon &amp; London, 1992).

<p><b>Portuguese heraldry</b> encompasses modern and historic heraldic achievements in Portugal and in the former Portuguese Empire. Heraldry has been in use in Portugal at least since the 12th century. Portuguese heraldry initially developed among the Iberian branch of the Latin heraldic tradition, in the late 14th century being deeply influenced by the English heraldry, latter developing its own distinctive features. Most of its present general characteristics were fixed in the 16th century by the heraldic ordinances of King Manuel I of Portugal. </p><p>Unlike the highly stylized and macaronic language used in the heraldry of many other countries, the Portuguese blazon is described in plain language, using usually only Portuguese terminology. </p>

The hatsadiling is considered to be the size of a house, with the head and body of a lion, trunk and tusks of an elephant, the comb of a cock, and the wings of a bird. According to an oral myth in northeastern Thailand, the bird once inhabited the legendary forest of Himavanta.

It was redesigned and rebuilt in the mid-19th century to defend against a new generation of iron-clad French warships. </p><p>By the start of the 20th century, the Thames defences had been moved further downriver to the estuary and the fort was disarmed. Its grounds were opened to the public as pleasure gardens, but the fort was taken back into military use temporarily during the Second World War.

She was a daughter either of Gaia or of Elpis (Hope), was described as "she who initiates and furthers communication" and had an altar at Athens. A tremendous gossip, Pheme was said to have pried into the affairs of mortals and gods, then repeated what she learned, starting off at first with just a dull whisper, but repeating it louder each time, until everyone knew. In art, she was usually depicted with wings and a trumpet.</p><p>In Roman mythology, Fama ("rumor") was described as having multiple tongues, eyes, ears and feathers by Virgil (in <i>Aeneid</i> IV line 180 and following) and other authors.  Virgil wrote that she "had her feet on the ground, and her head in the clouds, making the small seem great and the great seem greater." </p>

His aim was to explain the dramatic changes of the Mikhail Gorbachev era in their historical context. </p><p>Most of Hosking's works until this point had dealt with twentieth-century Russia and the Soviet Union, but after the collapse of the Soviet system he turned his attention to earlier periods of Russian history, producing <i>Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917</i> and <i>Russia and the Russians</i>. In these books, Hosking emphasized the polarity between the Russian Imperial idea (denoted by the term 'Rossia') and Russia's ethnic nationhood (defined by the older term of 'Rus'). According to Hosking, the development of the Russian Empire prevented the development of Russia as a nation state. In his next book <i>Rulers and Victims - The Russians in the Soviet Union</i>, Hosking examined aspects of this polarity in the Soviet context. </p><p>Hosking retired from UCL SSEES in December 2007.

<p><b>Jocelyn de Brakelond</b> or <i>Jocelin de Brakelonde</i> was an English monk and the author of a chronicle narrating the fortunes of the monastery of Bury St. Edmunds Abbey between 1173 and 1202. He is only known through his own work.</p><p>Joceylyn was a native of Bury St. Edmunds; he served his novitiate under Samson of Tottington, who was at that time master of the novices, but afterwards sub-sacrist, and, from 1182, abbot of the house. Jocelyn took the habit of religion in 1173, during the time of Abbot Hugo (1157–1180), through whose improvidence and laxity the abbey had become impoverished and the monks had lost discipline.</p><p>The fortunes of the abbey changed for the better with the election of Samson as Hugo's successor. Jocelyn, who became the abbot's chaplain within four months of the election, describes the administration of Samson at considerable length. He tells us that he was with Samson night and day for six years; the picture which he gives of his master, although coloured by enthusiastic admiration, is singularly frank and intimate. It is all the more convincing since Jocelyn is no stylist. His Latin is familiar and easy, but the reverse of classical. He thinks and writes as one whose interests are wrapped up in his house; and the unique interest of his work lies in the minuteness with which it describes the policy of a monastic administrator who was in his own day considered as a model.</p><p>Jocelyn has also been credited with an extant but unprinted tract on the election of Abbot Hugo (Harleian manuscript 1005, fol. 165); from internal evidence this appears to be an error. He mentions a (non-extant) work which he wrote, before the <i>Cronica</i>, on the miracles of Saint Robert of Bury, a boy found murdered in 1181 whose death during a period of rising anti-Semitism was blamed on the local Jews.</p><p>J.

<p>The <b>German Shoe Museum</b> (German: <i lang="de">Deutsches Schuhmuseum Hauenstein</i>, full name: <i>Museum für Schuhproduktion und Industriegeschichte Hauenstein</i>) is a museum in Hauenstein, Palatinate. Its exhibits cover the development of the local shoe industry. On four storeys of an old shoe factory, they illustrate both technical aspects of shoe manufacturing and the social and every day history of shoes.</p><p>The exhibition portrays the beginnings of the shoe industry in the nearby town of Pirmasens, which goes back to around 1800, when discharged soldiers had to earn a living. By the mid-19th century Pirmasens had developed into the most important site of the German shoe industry. This affected the little village of Hauenstein, which at the time consisted mainly of small farmers and forest workers. </p><p>In 1886 the Seibel brothers founded the first shoe factory in Hauenstein. By 1914, twenty factories had been established, with more than 1,000 employees. Despite the pressures to combine that arose from the French occupation, economic crises, and the war years, the number of factories had grown by 1960 to 35. Thereafter, however, progressive automation and the relocation of production to foreign countries led to a serious structural crisis in the German shoe industry, resulting in numerous businesses being closed.  </p><p>The German Shoe Museum is housed in one of these former production facilities. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p><b>William Stearns Davis</b> (April 30, 1877 – February 15, 1930) was an American educator, historian, and author. He has been cited as one who “contributed to history as a scholarly discipline, . . . [but] was intrigued by the human side of history, which, at the time, was neglected by the discipline.”  After first experimenting with short stories, he turned while still a college undergraduate to longer forms to relate, from an involved (fictional) character’s view, a number of critical turns of history.  This faculty for humanizing, even dramatizing, history characterized Davis’ later academic and professional writings as well, making them particularly suitable for secondary and higher education during the first half of the twentieth century in a field which, according to one editor, had “lost the freshness and robustness . . . the congeniality” that should mark the study of history.  Both Davis’ fiction and non-fiction are found in public and academic libraries today. </p>

He is the son of Set and Nephthys. </p><p>Hermes' and Anubis's similar responsibilities (they were both conductors of souls) led to the god Hermanubis.  He was popular during the period of Roman domination over Egypt. Depicted as having a human body and jackal head, with the sacred caduceus that belonged to the Greek god Hermes, he represented the Egyptian priesthood, engaged in the investigation of truth.</p><p>The divine name <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">Ἑρμανοῦβις</span> is known from a handful of epigraphic and literary sources, mostly of the Roman period. Plutarch cites the name as a designation of Anubis in his underworldly aspect, while Porphyry refers to Hermanubis as <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">σύνθετος</span> "composite" and <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">μιξέλλην</span> "half-Greek".</p><p>Although it was not common in traditional Greek religion to combine the names of two gods in this manner, the double determination of Hermanubis has some formal parallels in the earlier period. The most obvious is the god Hermaphroditus, attested from the fourth century BC onwards, but his name implies the paradoxical union of two different gods (Hermes and Aphrodite) rather than an assimilation in the manner of Hermanubis. </p>

It referred to the western part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed to the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply <b>Gallia</b> or <b>Narbonensis</b>. Septimania territory roughly corresponds with the former administrative region of Languedoc-Roussillon that merged into the new administrative region of Occitanie. Septimania passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba, which had been expanding from the south during the eighth century before its subsequent conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it <b>Gothia</b> or the <b>Gothic March</b> (<i>Marca Gothica</i>). </p><p>Septimania became a march of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from northern France based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of Toulouse, Provence, and ancient County of Barcelona. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as Occitania. This area was finally brought under effective control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the Albigensian Crusade after which it was assigned governors. From the end of the thirteenth century Septimania evolved into the royal province of Languedoc. </p><p>The name "Septimania" may derive from part of the Roman name of the city of Béziers, <i>Colonia Julia Septimanorum Beaterrae</i>, which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the Roman VII Legion in the city. Another possible derivation of the name is in reference to the seven cities (<i>civitates</i>) of the territory: Béziers, Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lodève, Maguelonne, and Nîmes. Septimania extended to a line halfway between the Mediterranean and the Garonne River in the northwest; in the east the Rhône separated it from Provence; and to the south its boundary was formed by the Pyrenees. </p>

If a person drinks the brew, known as the beer of oblivion, they forget they ever existed and are unable to return to the land of the living, for only Tuonetar and Tuoni's children were allowed to leave Tuonela.</p><p>When Väinämöinen asks Tuonetar to reveal the three magic words he is seeking she refuses and vows that he will never leave Tuonela alive. She then puts him to sleep with her magic wand and has her three-fingered son weave a thousand nets of iron and copper to catch him if he tries to escape down the river of Tuoni. Väinämöinen succeeds in escaping by turning into a serpent and swimming through the nets, and when he returns to Kalevala he warns people never to sin lest they end up in Tuonela. </p><p>Tuonetar is recognized as the Virgin of Death and the goddess of the subterranean worlds. She is the mother of Kipu-Tyttö, Kivutar, Vammatar, Kalma, and Loviatar, as well as numerous plagues, diseases, demons, and monsters.</p>
<p><b>Ahöla</b>, also known as <b>Ahul</b>,  is a spirit being, a kachina, embodied by a man, in Hopi religion. </p><p>Ahöla is one of the important chief katsinam for First and Second Mesas, in Hopi, because he opens the mid-winter Powamu ceremony, sometimes called the bean planting festival. On the first night of the festival, he performs inside a kiva, the subterranean, ceremonial space, before going with the Powamu Chief to give prayer feathers to Kachina Spring at dawn. Afterwards, Ahöla and the Powamu Chief visit all of the kivas and ceremonial houses, giving out bean and corn plants and marking the doorways with stripes of cornmeal. At the end of the ceremony, Ahöla descends to a shrine, bows four times to the Sun, and asks for health, happiness, long life, and good crops. Ahöla is also the friend of Eototo, and one legend tells of  Ahöla having his throat cut to let Eototo to escape. </p>

<p><b>Aino</b> is a figure in the Finnish national epic Kalevala. It relates that she was the beautiful sister of Joukahainen. Her brother, having lost a singing contest to the storied Väinämöinen, promised Aino's "hands and feet" in marriage if Väinämöinen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown. Aino's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person, but Aino did not want to marry such an old man. Rather than submit to this fate, Aino drowned herself (or ended up as a nix). However, she returned to taunt the grieving Väinämöinen as a salmon. </p><p>The name <i>Aino</i>, meaning "the only one",  was invented by Elias Lönnrot who composed the Kalevala.

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The first written records for the <b>history of France</b> appeared in the Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Roman writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language. </p><p>Over the course of the 1st millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman forces under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire. </p><p>In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration, most importantly by the Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France emerged from the western part of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987. </p><p>A succession crisis following the death of the last direct Capetian monarch in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years' War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The war formally began in 1337 following Philip VI's attempt to seize the Duchy of Aquitaine from its hereditary holder, Edward III of England, the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne.  Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of John II of France, fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war.  Among the notable figures of the war was Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English, establishing herself as a national heroine.  The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453. </p><p>Victory in the Hundred Years' War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and vastly increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the period known as the <i>Ancien Régime</i>, France transformed into a centralized absolute monarchy.  During the next centuries, France experienced the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation.  At the height of the French Wars of Religion, France became embroiled in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, Henry III, fought against rival factions the House of Bourbon and the House of Guise. Henry, King of Navarre, scion of the Bourbon family, would be victorious in the conflict and establish the French Bourbon dynasty.  A burgeoning worldwide colonial empire was established in the 16th century.  French political power reached a zenith under the rule of Louis XIV, "The Sun King", builder of Versailles Palace. </p><p>In the late 18th century the monarchy and associated institutions were overthrown in the French Revolution.  The country was governed for a period as a Republic, until the French Empire was declared by Napoleon Bonaparte. Following Napoleon's defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, France went through several further regime changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then briefly as a Second Republic, and then as a Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870. </p><p>France was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I, fighting alongside the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan, the United States and smaller allies against Germany and the Central Powers. </p><p>France was one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940. The Third Republic was dismantled, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist Vichy government.  Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many Jews were killed. Charles de Gaulle led the Free France movement that one-by-one took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the wartime Resistance.  Following liberation in summer 1944, a Fourth Republic was established. France slowly recovered economically, and enjoyed a baby boom that reversed its very low fertility rate.  Long wars in Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political defeat. In the wake of the Algerian Crisis  of 1958, Charles de Gaulle set up the French Fifth Republic. Into the 1960s decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while smaller parts were incorporated into the French state as overseas departments and collectivities. Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the UN Security Council and NATO.  It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the European Union. Despite slow economic growth in recent years, it remains a strong economic, cultural, military and political factor in the 21st century. </p>

It contains several traces of Islamic mythology such as the Sundanese gods are connected to biblical figure of Adam, also the demon Idajil connected to the Devil (Satan) in Biblical tradition. The present myth contain influences of Hindu and Islamic mythology. However, most of the mythology actually derived from far older pre-Hindu and pre-Islamic aspect of ancient Sundanese culture. Some trace of Javanese culture also present, such as the reference to the deity Batara Ismaya disguised as the old servant Ki Semar, and the mentioning of Nawang Wulan apsara that magically cooks rice.
