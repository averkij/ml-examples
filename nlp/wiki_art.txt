In 1924 he married Trude Hess (1902 - 1987), who subsequently also studied art history and became a noted scholar and collector herself. He completed his dissertation in Halle under Paul Frankl in 1925 with the title <i>Die Kirchen der Bettelorden in Deutschland (1240–1340)</i>.  Frankl's work remained a strong influence for Krautheimer throughout his life. Willibald Sauerländer contends that it was Krautheimer who later introduced Frankl's work to the United States.  The systematizing methodology of Krautheimer's mentor, Frankl, "never left Krautheimer" according to Willibald Sauerlander. </p><p>In 1927 he completed his habilitation under Richard Hamann in Marburg. The same year, while researching at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, Krautheimer developed the idea for a handbook of Roman churches with a colleague, Rudolf Wittkower, later to become the <i>Corpus Basilicarum</i>. In 1928 he accepted a <i>privatdozent</i> teaching position at Marburg. Except for studies-in-residence at the Hertziana (1930/31, 32/33) he remained at Marburg. The Krautheimers fled Nazi persecution, leaving Germany for good. Between 1933–35 Krautheimer worked on the <i>Corpus</i>, accepting paying employment from Frankl's son in the city. The ever-declining political situation for Jews in Axis-alliance countries compelled the Krautheimers to emigrate to the United States of America. Krautheimer found a position at the University of Louisville, Kentucky, a university he purportedly had never heard of. At his request, Louisville hired another fleeing art historian, Krautheimer's friend from school days, Justus Bier. Krautheimer moved to Vassar in 1937 at the request of Vassar's Art Department chair, Agnes Claflin. That same year saw Krautheimer's first volume of the <i>Corpus Basilicarum Christianarum Romae</i>, a scholarly inventory and documentation of the early Christian churches in Rome eventually running to five volumes. The set would not be completed until 1977. Following US entry into World War II, he and Trude became naturalized citizens. Richard volunteered for duty as a senior research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services for the years 1942–44. Here he analyzed aerial photographs of Rome to assist in the protection of historic buildings during bombing. While still at Vassar, he taught (with lecturer status) at New York University (1938–49). He moved to NYU permanently in 1952 as the Jayne Wrightsman Professor of Fine Arts. The early 1950s were devoted to researching his one monograph on an artist, Lorenzo Ghiberti, published jointly with his wife in 1956. He would serve for one semester as acting Director of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. </p><p>Krautheimer next engaged in what he called his most difficult book to research and write: the survey volume on early Christian architecture for the Pelican History of Art. The manuscript was completed in 1963 and published two years later. The volume turned out to be one of the finest syntheses of late antique/early medieval architecture published and brought Krautheimer his widest readership. He revised and reissued the work twice, in 1975 and 1979. After a second tome on Ghiberti in 1971, Krautheimer retired from NYU as Samuel F. B. Morse Professor <i>Emeritus</i> and returned to Rome. Wolfgang Lotz, friend and fellow architectural historian, offered him a residence at the Bibliotheca Hertziana. There, Krautheimer completed his long-standing research on the <i>Corpus Basilicarum</i>. In these final years he set to work writing two of his most synthetic and lyrical works on art history. <i>Rome: Profile of a City</i> (1980) and <i>The Rome of Alexander VII</i> (1985) combined social history, vast breadth of archival knowledge and insightful architectural history into single volumes. In both cases, Krautheimer selected comparatively neglected periods in Roman history to offer a compelling narrative of the interaction of public works and patronage. While assisting friends with plans for his 100th birthday, Krautheimer died at 97 at the Palazzo Zuccari. His wife had preceded him in death seven years before.  His many students at New York University included Howard Saalman, Leo Steinberg, James S. Ackerman, Frances Huemer, Marvin Trachtenberg, Slobodan Curcic, and Dale Kinney. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p><i><b>Over The Top</b></i> is a 1918 oil-on-canvas painting by John Nash.  It depicts a counter-attack on Welsh Ridge in northern France on 30 December 1917, during the First World War.    It is held by Imperial War Museum, London. </p><p>The painting measures 79.8 × 108 centimetres (31.4 × 42.5 in).  It shows British soldiers in heavy winter greatcoats scrambling up from their trenches to advance over a snow-covered landscape.  Two already lie dead or wounded on the duckboards in the base of the trench and one on the snow.  The others move to the right without looking back.  Threatening clouds hang in the sky above, billowing darkly.  Two studies held by the Imperial War museum show the carefully balanced composition. </p><p>The painting is based on Nash's experience while serving in the 1st Battalion of the Artists Rifles (28th London Regiment).  His unit went "over the top", to push towards Marcoing near Cambrai. Of the 80 men, 68 were killed or wounded by the shell-fire during the first few minutes. Nash was one of the 12 that survived.  He made the painting in early 1918, having returned to England and been recommended by his brother Paul Nash to become an official war artist.  The work was commissioned by the Ministry of Information and painted in a rented seed-shed at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. </p> <ul class="gallery mw-gallery-traditional"><li class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px"> 		<li class="gallerybox" style="width: 155px"> </ul>

<p><b>Vessna Perunovich</b> is a visual artist based in Toronto, Ontario. She was born in 1960 in Zaječar, Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. Her father was originally from Montenegro and her mother was from Serbia. Her family immigrated to Toronto in 1988. She earned her B.F.A in 1984 at the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Three years later she earned her M.F.A. also from the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Belgrade. In 1999, she participated as a guest lecturer at the Dundas School of Art in Hamilton, Ontario, titled "Naked/Perpetual Crises I". In 2004, she was invited to the University of Guelph in Ontario to guest lecture. In the same year, she was also invited by the Informal Architectures Symposium in Banff, Alberta to do an artist presentation. She is currently a sessional teacher at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto and has been since 2005. Her most recent artist talks were from 2006: one at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto and the other one in Havana, Cuba for the "International Artists' Presentation".</p><p><br> Vessna Perunovich works in a variety of media including sculpture, painting, drawing, video installation and performance. Her aim seems to be an attempt to express the most with the least amount of materials. She often uses pantyhose to create sculptural pieces. "Pantyhose for Perunovich is emblematic of society's efforts to contain and restrict our freedom, symbolizing the behavioral codes imposed upon us which prevent us from realizing our dreams and aspirations. "Vessna's multi-media explorations are inspired and derived from her personal experiences, yet they have an effect on all of our experiences; from our collective memories, anxieties, questions and desires. She utilizes her materials and converts them into imaginative depictions of the body, while exploring the conflicting boundaries of pleasure and pain. Perunovich filled pantyhose with everyday objects to stretch the material to test its physical limits.</p><p><br></p>

<p>The <b>Lange Hotel</b> is a historic commercial building and former hotel in the village of West Alexandria, Ohio, United States.  One of the area's leading early farmhouses, it is the latest in a series of hotels on the same spot, and it has been designated a historic site. </p><p>The portion of Preble County around West Alexandria was first settled between 1800 and 1810, and the village itself was platted in 1818 and incorporated eighteen years later.  Just two years after the village was laid out, local resident Valentine Mikesell was granted a hotelier's license for the property where the Lange Hotel stands.  Its location was fortuitous for a hotel: the Lange sits at the village's central intersection, along the old road to Dayton to the east.  As the years passed, West Alexandria prospered; sawmills and gristmills were established within its limits, and before long it was a commercial center for the surrounding agricultural countryside.  A larger lodging facility, the Eagle Hotel, occupied the present site by the 1880s, but it was demolished for the construction of the present building in 1887.</p><p>West Alexandria's hilltop site near Twin Creek and its location along a major road made it the junction of multiple important transportation arteries.  By the 1880s, a new hotel was needed, and the result was the present frame two-and-a-half-story building with Italianate elements, built on a foundation of limestone.  Despite the new construction, there was soon a lack of space, so a two-story wing was constructed on the western side of the original building in 1904.  Today, the hotel remains on a busy street — Dayton Street is now U.S. Route 35 — but by the early 1990s, it had ceased to be a hotel and was vacant.  Nevertheless, it retained its structural integrity; in January 1991, the hotel was declared historically significant enough and sufficiently well preserved to warrant addition to the National Register of Historic Places, a designation that it officially received on 25 January.  Essential to its status as a historic site was its rôle in the community's history as a transportation center.</p>

<p><b>Kitchen sink realism</b> (or <b>kitchen sink drama</b>) is a British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film, and television plays, whose protagonists usually could be described as "angry young men" who were disillusioned with modern society. It used a style of social realism, which depicted the domestic situations of working class Britons, living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore controversial social and political issues ranging from abortion to homelessness. The harsh, realistic style contrasted sharply with the escapism of the previous generation's so-called "well-made plays". </p><p>The films, plays and novels employing this style are often set in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the accents and slang heard in those regions. The film <i>It Always Rains on Sunday</i> (1947) is a precursor of the genre, and the John Osborne play <i>Look Back in Anger</i> (1956) is thought of as the first of the genre. The gritty love-triangle of <i>Look Back in Anger</i>, for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. Shelagh Delaney's 1958 play <i>A Taste of Honey</i> (which was made into a film of the same name in 1961), is about a teenage schoolgirl who has an affair with a black sailor, gets pregnant, and then moves in with a gay male acquaintance; it raises issues such as class, race, gender and sexual orientation. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as <i>Coronation Street</i> and <i>EastEnders</i>.</p><p>In art, "Kitchen Sink School" was a term used by critic David Sylvester to describe painters who depicted social realist–type scenes of domestic life.</p>

<p><b>CIBC 750 Lawrence</b> is a two-tower office complex in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, built in the early 1980s. It is part of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's (CIBC) head office operations outside of Commerce Court and the main head quarters of CIBC Credit Card Services, including Visa call centres and Visa operations. </p><p>Employees in Visa are members of the Steel Workers Union in Toronto, USW Local 8300. The union represents those workers who used to be called the Union of Bank Employees Local 2104. The Visa call centre at 750 is now the only unionized department in CIBC, but at the time of the strike in 1986, the Commerce Court Mail Room, Stationery Department, Mortgage Department, a few branches in downtown Toronto, and the Internal Mail Courier Trucks that transported correspondences within the greater Toronto area were also unionized. Although the Stationery Department, Mortgage Department and the branches did not take part in the strike, they supported the workers. During negotiations with CIBC, the Mortgage Department broke away from the union and never joined again. </p><p>750 Lawrence consists of two buildings, one six stories (West) and the other, ten stories (East), built by Toronto-based firm Bregman + Hamann Architects (B+H) in 1981. B+H is the same firm involved in renovations in 2001. Even though CIBC sold most of its buildings, including Commerce Court, in the late 1990s, 750 Lawrence continues to be owned by CIBC, and is managed by Brookfield Global Integrated Solutions for CIBC. </p><p>It is located in Lawrence Heights across the street from Lawrence Square Shopping Centre and a short walk to Lawrence West subway station. When 750 Lawrence opened in 1981, it housed CIBC Mortgage Department which took up three floors in the West Tower, CIBC Marketing which took up two floors in the East Tower and one floor in the West, several smaller departments, and CIBC Dealer Plan department. Dealer Plan had a small parking lot where repossessed cars and small trucks were kept. That parking lot is now known as the Contractors' parking lot today. 750 Lawrence used to be a much smaller building that housed the CIBC Stationery Department. </p><p>The west wall of the West Tower was damaged in 2001 by a large fire at a housing development located directly to the west at 760 Lawrence. Every window on that west wall was cracked or broken except one. </p><p>Until 2001, 750 Lawrence housed an internal branch for employees. The branch was a sub-unit of the head office branch at Commerce Court West and shared the same transit number, 0002. Even though this branch has closed, the building itself maintains the same transit number. The space occupied by this branch was renovated in 2001 to be an employee lounge and six conference rooms and four Visa Training rooms. In 2014, CIBC installed 4 new banking machines in the West main floor. Two of those machines were among the first CIBC machines to offer an envelope-free deposit service, where the machine scans your bill deposit and counts it. </p><p>Between the two wings is a tree-lined courtyard with benches and used for staff events. </p>

<p>The <b>Skulpturhalle Basel</b> is a museum in Basel, Switzerland, featuring cast replicas of antique sculpture.  With around 2,000 casts it is the largest collection of its kind in the country, having tripled in size between 1985 and 2010.  Since 1961 the collection has been managed by the Antikenmuseum Basel. </p><p>The collection was started in 1830.  From 1849 it was located in the newly opened <i>Museum an der Augustinergasse</i> (now the location of the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Cultures).  In 1887 it moved into the Basel Kunsthalle, where a new wing known as the "Skulpturenhalle" had been built especially for it.  The casts had to be warehoused in 1927 when the national art collection was temporarily moved into the Kunsthalle, creating a need for more space.  In 1940 the cast collection found a provisional home in a disused factory, four years after plans for a new building had failed to pass a referendum; the new building finally materialised in 1963. </p><p>When original works are split into pieces across various museums, the casts allow all the parts to be brought back together so that complete reconstructions of antique sculptures can be made.  The unique "Parthenon Project" assembles casts of every surviving sculptural remnant from the Parthenon Temple in Athens, and exhibits them so as to demonstrate their original arrangements.  Also in the exhibition is an array of architectural models on a scale of 1:20. </p>

<p><b>Magnetic Field Architecture</b> (MFA) is based on  Lenz’s Law, which states that if a magnetic field moves relative to a conductor, an eddy current is generated in that conductor. The technology uses engines to generate a primary magnetic field. These, in turn, create eddy currents, which generate a magnetic field of their own, mirroring the primary field causing them to repel one another. By focusing this electromagnetic energy downward, they are capable of generating  lift. </p>

<p><b>Willem de Keyser</b> or <b>De Keysar</b> (born c.1647) was a Flemish artist. </p><p>Born at Antwerp about the year 1647, he was trained as a jeweller, but as an amateur practised in miniature, enamel, and oil-colours. Having painted some altar-pieces at Antwerp, his business called him to Dunkirk, where he painted a picture, for the chapel of the English nuns, who were so pleased with it, that they persuaded De Keyser to go to England, and gave him letters of recommendation to Lord Melfort, then in favour with James II. The enthusiastic painter could not resist the proposal; he embarked on board an English vessel, and, unknown to his wife or family, sailed for England. His reception was equal to his wishes. He was introduced to the king, who promised to countenance him, and several persons of rank, who had known him at Antwerp, encouraged him in his new vocation. </p><p>Transported with this prospect he sent for his wife, ordering her to dismiss his workmen, and convert his effects into money. Within half a year the bubble burst; the Revolution happened, De Keyser's friends could no longer be his protectors, his business decreased, and the pursuit of the philosopher's stone, to which he had recourse in his despair, completed his ruin. He died at the age of forty-five, about the year 1692. He left a daughter, whom he had taken great pains to instruct, and with success. She painted small portraits in oil, and copied well. </p>

<p>  <span></span> </p> <p><b>Benthall Hall</b> is a 16th-century English country house in Benthall in the town of Broseley, Shropshire, England, and a few miles from the historic Ironbridge Gorge.

It is still occupied by the Benthall family, but has been owned by the National Trust since 1958, and is open to the public every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday (February – October). </p><p>The Hall was built around 1580, probably on the site of an earlier 12th-century medieval manor and manor house. During the Civil War it was garrisoned, and was a site of several skirmishes. </p><p>Local villagers believe that this is the historic site that inspired Kanu, the UK grime artist Kano to write the award winning album of Made In The Mano, as he would often visit this manor house in his childhood and the picture of the hall inspired the story behind the song, <i>T-Shirt Weather In The Manor</i>. </p><p>The garden is largely the product of two tenants. George Maw (1832–1912), local pottery manufacturer and crocus enthusiast developed the garden from around 1865 onwards. Subsequently, the Victorian era Romantic painter and sculptor Robert Bateman (1842–1922), who was the son of a famous horticulturalist, added the rockeries and terraces of the current garden. </p><p>The Commonwealth era church of St. Bartholomew stands close by the Hall.

<p>The <b>Würzburg Residence</b> (German: <i>Würzburger Residenz</i>) is a palace in Würzburg, Germany. Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch, representatives of the Austrian/South German Baroque style, were involved in the construction, as well as Robert de Cotte and Germain Boffrand, who were followers of the French Style. Balthasar Neumann, court architect of the Bishop of Würzburg, was the principal architect of the Residence, which was commissioned by  the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg Johann Philipp Franz von Schönborn and his brother Friedrich Carl von Schönborn in 1720, and  completed in 1744. The Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, assisted by his son, Domenico, painted frescoes in the building.  </p><p>Interiors considered masterworks of Baroque/Rococo or Neoclassical architecture and art include the grand staircase, the chapel, and the Imperial Hall.

<p><b>Delmar Gardens of Oklahoma City</b> was an amusement park in Oklahoma City that operated from 1902 to 1910. </p><p>After the emergence of New York's Coney Island, the fad of waterside amusement parks graced with wooden boardwalks spread across the country. Although Oklahoma City was only founded in 1889, civic leaders were eager to provide similar facilities in Oklahoma Territory. </p><p>John Sinopoulo and Joseph Marre, who trained at the original <b>Delmar Gardens</b> in St. Louis, built the park on the east bank of the North Canadian River on property owned by civic leader and developer Charles Colcord's Colcord Park Corporation. The park was located on about 40 acres (160,000 m<sup>2</sup>) between Reno, Western and the river. Today's Wheeler Park constituted the southeast boundary of the complex. The park boasted of a 3,000 seat theater, dance pavilion, a horse racing track, baseball field, swimming pool, exotic animal zoo, railway, a boardwalk beer garden, amusement rides, a penny arcade, a floating wedding chapel, and a hotel and restaurant. The Gardens and Park were served by the city's extensive trolley service, which brought visitors from suburbs miles away in a matter of minutes. </p><p>Sinopoulo was a Greek immigrant who wanted to build a stylish amusement complex that held a uniting theme throughout a park setting. He used an elaborate Art Nouveau styling that blended blissfully with the surrounding woods and river. The interior of the Delmar Garden Theater was designed in intricate Victorian gingerbread, with Art Nouveau accents. Orchestra seating held leather upholstered opera chairs, box seats contained comfortable wicker chairs and love-seats, and three horseshoe shaped balconies were equipped with steep pitch bleachers. While the auditorium had soft gas lighting, the heavily draped stage was brilliantly illuminated by electric switchboard lighting. Built to be a vaudeville house, Delmar Garden Theater also installed film equipment in 1903 to feature The Great Train Robbery, which ran for eleven weeks. Regardless of the fact that film showings at the Delmar proved to be successful, management preferred to continue mainly as a two-a-day vaudeville venue, with only an occasional movie thrown in at the end of a weak vaudeville program. (One advantage for vaudevillians appearing on the family oriented Delmar stage was that they could also present "adult material" in late night sketches at the Delmar Saloon). </p><p>During its short lifespan Delmar Gardens served as Oklahoma City's premiere playground, drawing thousands of visitors and attracting entertainers like Lon Chaney Sr. and Buster Keaton, boxers John L. Sullivan and Jack Dempsey, and the legendary race horse Dan Patch. Lon Chaney, Sr. was appearing at Delmar Theater in 1905 when he rescued a beautiful 16-year-old songbird from a flooded basement dressing room. Her name was Cleva Crieghton, and after a whirlwind courtship the couple married in Oklahoma City. Whether or not they took advantage of the romantic Delmar Garden floating chapel is lost to time. In 1904 Tom Mix performed at Delmar Gardens with the Oklahoma Cavalry Band, where he met and became engaged to Kitty Jewel Perrine, daughter of the Perrine Hotel owner where Tom was renting a room. </p><p>Delmar Gardens was adjacent to Wheeler Park and the city's first zoo. On May 13, 1902, James B. Wheeler deeded land to the City of Oklahoma City, roughly from the Frisco railroad tracks (today's I-40 realignment) to the Canadian River, "to be perpetually used by party of second part as a public park for the free use and benefit of the citizens of Oklahoma City." As part of the conveyance, the park's name would never be changed. </p><p>The entire complex, however, fronted a prairie river, and not the Atlantic Ocean. Swarms of mosquitoes that accompanied the river's annual flooding contributed to Delmar Gardens' demise, and the advent of prohibition was the death blow. It closed in 1910, and the buildings were razed the following year. The zoo, which opened in 1904, moved to Northeast 50th and Eastern Avenue after most of the animals were killed in a major flood in 1923, and became the foundation of today's Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Gardens. </p><p>With the exception of Wheeler Park, little evidence of Delmar Gardens and its environs remains today. On June 16, 1928, John J. Harden opened his mission revival style Market Theatre (also 3000 seats) on the far northwest corner of the Delmar site. The 40,000-square-foot (3,700 m<sup>2</sup>) structure, built at a cost of $500,000, featured farmers' fresh produce on the first floor, with concerts, dances, boxing matches and roller skating on the second floor. Hank Williams, Bob Wills and Count Basie have performed there. Now operated as the Oklahoma City Farmers Public Market, the facility's boxoffice lobby, balcony, and stage remain intact. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.</p><p>Then Senator Barack Obama made a Presidential campaign stop at the Farmer's Market on March 19, 2007.</p>
<p>The <b>Dr. William Gifford House</b> is a historic Tudor Revival house in Cleveland, Ohio, United States.  Located east of downtown, the house sits in a neighborhood of historic houses and is a part of the Upper Prospect Multiple Resource Area. It was designed by Cleveland architect William W. Sabin and built in about 1901. The Gifford House is actually atypical of Sabin's style: working in Cleveland from 1888 to 1923, he is known better as a designer of large public buildings, especially churches (including the First Church of Christ in Euclid, also listed on the National Register) and police stations.</p><p>It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1984, primarily because it was a "property that embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction or represents the works of a master, or possess high artistic values, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity." The house retains its historic appearance with brick and stucco walls and the half timbers typical of the Tudor Revival style of architecture.</p><p>Unlike other neighborhood houses listed on the National Register, some of which are now offices, the Gifford House remains a residence.  It has been owned and used as a fraternity house since 1960 by the Delta Epsilon chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon, which includes students from the nearby Cleveland State University. In December 2011, a planned renovation of the house received an Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credit. It will be renovated as offices for Ziska Architecture and one apartment.</p>
<p><i><b>The Little Prince and the Aviator</b></i> is a musical with a book by Hugh Wheeler, lyrics by Don Black, and music by John Barry.</p><p>Based on the classic book by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the musical deviates from the original in that aviator Toni, whose plane crashes in the Sahara Desert, explicitly is real-life author Saint-Exupéry, and the plot alternates flashbacks to actual events in his life with his interaction with the fictional Little Prince, a refugee from Asteroid B-612. </p><p>Undaunted by the critical and commercial failure of the 1974 musical screen adaptation by Lerner and Loewe, A. Joseph Tandet, a co-producer of the movie who owned the rights to the story, proceeded with his plans for a Broadway production. To save money, he decided to forgo an out-of-town tryout. </p><p>Previews began on December 26, 1981 at the Alvin Theatre. Directed by Jerry Adler and choreographed by Billy Wilson, it starred Michael York as the Aviator and Anthony Rapp as the Little Prince, with Ellen Greene in a supporting role. The show closed after sixteen previews. </p><p>Producer Tandent sued the Nederlander Organization, claiming they had forced him to shut down the production with their demands for more money during its final week. He eventually was awarded $1,000,000,  representing two-thirds of his investment. </p>

<p><b>Enceinte</b> (from Latin incinctus: girdled, surrounded) is a French term denoting the "main defensive enclosure of a fortification". For a castle this is the main defensive line of wall towers and curtain walls enclosing the position. For a settlement it would be the main town wall with its associated gatehouses and towers and walls. </p><p>According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, the term was strictly applied to the continuous line of bastions and curtain walls forming "the body of the place", this last expression being often used as synonymous with <i>enceinte</i>. However, the outworks or defensive wall close to the enceinte were not considered as forming part of it. In early 20th-century fortification, the enceinte was usually simply the <i>innermost</i> continuous line of fortifications.</p><p>In architecture, generally, an enceinte is the close or precinct of a cathedral, abbey, castle, etc.</p>

<p><b>Subversive affirmation</b> is an artistic performance that overemphasizes prevailing ideologies and thereby calls them into question. Simultaneously with affirmation, the affirmed concepts are revealed, and artists distance themselves from those concepts. Strategies of subversive affirmation include <i>over-identification</i>, <i>over-affirmation</i>, <i>yes revolution</i> and paradoxical intervention. </p><p>According to Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse the methods of subversive affirmation have been developing in Eastern European art since the 1960s. Subversive affirmation was initially chosen because of the necessity to conform to socialist ideology, which is then adopted deliberately. In the late 80s these tactics were carried over to Western art and activism. The term "affirmation" was introduced by Moscow conceptualists to describe Vladimir Sorokin's novels. Sorokin exaggerated serious realism in the style of the 19th century novel or in the style of socialist realism. </p><p>The concept of subversive affirmation is often credited to the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek in his 1993 essay 'Why Are Laibach and the Neue Slowenische Kunst Not Fascists?'  In his essay Žižek made use of the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan to argue that in its musical and artistic performance, Laibach (band) was not providing an ironic imitation of official communist state ideology, but was frustrating the system by over-identifying with its obscene superego underside and manipulating the process of transference with the totalitarian state. The term was used earlier, however, in Marry Ann Doane's seminal essay "Film and the Masquerade: Theorising the Female Spectator," where she considers how female spectators identify, overidentify, and counteridentify with women on screen who are seldom ascribed interiorities. </p><p>Žižek's psychoanalytic approach to subversive affirmation and over-identification is applied to the study of the work of Michael Moore, IRWIN, The Yes Men, Atelier Van Lieshout, and Christoph Schlingensief in a book edited by the Dutch collective BAVO in 2007. In <i>Brave New Avant Garde</i>, Marc James Léger develops Žižek's theory in relation to Lacan's concept of the Sinthome and the Discourse of the Analyst (Four discourses), arguing that Social practice (art) can in some cases be understood in its connection to the Avant-garde.</p>

<p>Built in 1880 and opening as the Natatorium on June 17, 1880, it was a bathing house and swimming school. After alterations it became the Howard Auditorium opening April 6, 1891. The name was soon changed to Auditorium and it became an ice skating rink in Spring on 1894. It was remodelled to the plans of architect J.B. McElphatrick and reopened September 30, 1895. In 1896 it was remodelled again to the plans of architectural firm J.B. McElphatrick and a Palm Court was built on the roof garden. The old Auditorium was closed on April 4, 1903 and was demolished. </p><p>On the site rose a new Auditorium Theatre which opened on September 12, 1904 with Keith’s Vaudeville and moving pictures. It was designed by architectural firm J.D. Allen &amp; Co. of Philadelphia. It was taken over by the Shubert Bros. in 1909 until 1913. Briefly operated by Poli, it returned to the Shuberts in 1918.

<p><b>Milton Menasco </b> (January 22, 1890 – June 7, 1974) was an American  painter and  art director of silent movies. </p><p>Born in 1890 in Los Angeles, California, Menasco began his art career in the early days of Hollywood, when his "blood and thunder" posters enticed movie fans into theaters to watch the first silent pictures. He was commissioned to do mural paintings at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco for the World's Fair in 1915. </p><p>His vivid use of colors and graphics won him recognition in Hollywood, where he worked on 33 films—29 times as art director and twice as set director. In 1925 he was the architecture and set director for the original film based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>The Lost World</i>. This film received accolades for its innovative art direction and special effects. To quote one review in the NewTimes: "And while Harry O. Hoyt is credited as director, a host of fellow auteurs must take credit for Lost World's still impressive thrills, especially the effects work of Willis O'Brien (who would later animate <i>King Kong</i> in 1933) and the wild set design from Milton Menasco." A complete list of Menasco's film credits is given here. </p><p>In 1925 Menasco went to New York City as art director for a film making company and turned to advertising. He also painted portraits and water colors of horses and ships during this time which he sold in the City's galleries. During World War II, <i>Life magazine</i> commissioned him to draw air and sea battles to chronicle the war in Europe and in the Pacific Theater. </p><p>After the war, Menasco moved to Kentucky to devote himself entirely to his real love, horse portraiture. Here he painted the equine racing greats of the nation and helped with art direction at the <i>Thoroughbred Record</i> and <i>Sporting News</i>. He and his wife purchased a farm where an old brick house built in the 18th century served for many years as his studio. </p><p>Horsemen admired the richness and feeling reflected in Menasco's paintings, and his clients included John Hay Whitney, Isabel Dodge Sloane, President Ronald Reagan and Allaire du Pont. One of his first large paintings was for Lucille Markey depicting nine of her horses at Calumet Farm, including Citation, Coaltown and others grouped in the track with exercise boys up. Menasco also painted Secretariat for owner Penny Chenery. </p><p>In 1953 Menasco painted the famous broodmare La Troienne in a work entitled "La Troienne and Her Foals: Eighteen Vignettes and One Painting Together in One Frame" for John Whitney. The painting was exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1999 it sold from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney through Sotheby's auction house for £74,000 (c. US$120,000). </p><p>In 1957, Menasco painted Doubledogdare and Delta for Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. The artist explained that although the actual painting had taken him about three months to complete, "behind it goes all the training, study and experience of my life." </p><p>A distinguishing mark of Menasco's paintings is the detail to sky and landscape backgrounds. A perfect example of this detail is apparent in Nashua, with Eddie Arcaro up, painted by Menasco at Hialeah Park for Leslie Combs II. The background shows the track and a ring of palm trees. </p><p>Milton Menasco died in 1974 of a heart attack at his farm in Versailles, Kentucky. </p>

A 1925 <i>New York Times</i> article singles him out as the greatest Yiddish comic actor of the time.</p><p>He was born in Lemberg (Lwów), Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). At the age of 18 he formed his own theater company in Galicia; he emigrated to the U.S. in 1912.</p><p>Satz played the male lead in the 1931 film <i>His Wife's Lover</i> (<i>Zayn Vaybs Lubovnik</i>), which was billed as the "first Jewish musical comedy talking picture". He also played on Broadway, one of his more noted roles being Abe Potash in the 1926 <i>Potash and Perlmuter</i> of A. H. Woods.</p><p>He starred in <i>A Galitsianer Khasene (A wedding in Galitsia)</i> (music by Herman Wohl, lyrics Boris Rozenthal) with Zina Goldstein and in <i>Ven di zun geyt oyf (Sunrise)</i> with Ola Lilith.

<p><b>Nahma Sandrow</b> is a scholar of theater and cultural history, and author of the books <i>Vagabond Stars: A World History of Yiddish Theater</i>;  <i>God, Man, and Devil: Yiddish Plays in Translation</i>; and <i>Surrealism: Theater, Arts, Ideas</i>. She is also the author of <i>Kuni-Leml</i> and <i>Vagabond Stars</i>, prize-winning Off-Broadway musicals based on Yiddish theatre material. She is Professor Emerita at Bronx Community College of the City University of New York, and has lectured at Oxford University, Harvard University, the Smithsonian Institution, and elsewhere. </p><p>Joseph Papp, writing in the <i>New York Times</i> Book Review, observed about <i>Vagabond Stars</i>: "what makes Sandrow's work distinctive is the unusual blend of impeccable scholarship and hilarious backstage anecdote."</p><p>In 1984 Samuel Freedman, of the <i>New York Times</i>, described the Off-Broadway success of <i>Kuni-Leml</i>, based on Abraham Goldfaden's Yiddish play <i>The Two Kuni-Lemls</i>, of 1880, as "largely attributable to Nahma Sandrow", noting that her work in researching, translating, and adapting the play had yielded a production with contemporary resonance.</p>
<p>The <b>Little White House</b> was the personal retreat of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, located in the Historic District of Warm Springs, Georgia. He first came to Warm Springs (formerly known as Bullochville) in 1924 for polio treatment, and liked the area so much that, as Governor of New York, he had a home built on nearby Pine Mountain. The house was finished in 1932. Roosevelt kept the house after he became President, using it as a presidential retreat. He died there on April 12, 1945, three months into his fourth term. </p><p>The house was opened to the public as a museum in 1948. A major attraction of the museum is the portrait that the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff was painting of him when he died, now known as the "Unfinished Portrait".  It hangs near a finished portrait that Shoumatoff completed later from sketches and memory. </p><p>The house is operated by the State of Georgia as the <b>Little White House Historic Site</b>, also known as <b>Roosevelt's Little White House Historic Site</b>. </p>

<p><b>McMullen Museum of Art</b> is the university art museum of Boston College in Brighton, Massachusetts, near the main campus in Chestnut Hill.   </p><p>The Museum holds an extensive permanent collection that spans the history of art from Europe, Asia and the Americas, and has significant representation of Gothic and Baroque tapestries, Italian paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries, and American paintings of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Well-known artists represented in the museum include Amedeo Modigliani, Frank Stella, Françoise Gilot, Alexander Ney, and John La Farge.  </p><p>Despite being a university art museum residing on a college campus, the McMullen Museum of Art organizes multidisciplinary exhibitions that have received national and international recognition. Stephen Kinzer of The New York Times has written that it is in the vanguard of museums creating exhibitions that "reach far beyond traditional art history," providing political, historical, and cultural context for works on view.</p>  <p>Recent significant exhibitions include "Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections" (2016) and "Saints and Sinners" (1999), featuring Caravaggio's The Taking of the Christ, which reportedly attracted the largest audience for any university museum exhibition up to that time. "Edvard Munch: Psyche, Symbol, and Expression" (2001) was the largest American exhibition of Munch's work since 1978. A retrospective of the work of Surrealist Roberto Matta (2004), organized by university faculty from the romance languages, art history, and theology departments, was also well received. Most recently, "Pollock Matters" (2007) received much media attention, comprising over 150 paintings, drawings, photographs, and sculptures, exploring the personal and artistic relationship between famed American Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock and noted Swiss-born photographer and graphic designer Herbert Matter.  </p><p>The McMullen Museum of Art reopen for its fall 2012 season with the exhibition "Paul Klee: Philosophical Vision; From Nature to Art".  </p><p>The museum, which opened in Devlin Hall in 1993, was officially named The Charles S. and Isabella V. McMullen Museum of Art in 1996 in honor of the parents of the Boston College benefactor, trustee and art collector John J. McMullen.  </p><p>In September 2016, the museum relocated to 2101 Commonwealth Avenue on Boston College's Brighton Campus. The new facility features nearly three times the exhibition space of its previous location in Devlin Hall, state-of-the art lighting, movable walls, humidity and climate control, and extensive storage for the museum's growing permanent collection. </p>
<p><b>19;29</b> was a London-based theatre company who specialised in making work in undiscovered or under-explored sites, interrogating the atmosphere and heritage of these spaces and making performances in response to them. </p><p>The company was formed in 2005 by Artistic Directors Felix Mortimer and Susanna Davies-Crook. </p>
<p><b>Mary Blood Mellen</b> (1819–1886) was an American painter who was one of several individuals (including William Bradford, Benjamin Champney (1817–1907), and George Merchant Jr.) who studied under Fitz Henry Lane (also called Fitz Hugh Lane).  Mellen is one of a number of women painters associated with the Hudson River School of artists in nineteenth-century New England. Her paintings often included landscapes and maritime images.  Though she spent time in New York and Connecticut, Mellen lived primarily in Massachusetts, and many of her paintings find their source in the Massachusetts and Maine landscapes and seascapes. In 1840, she married the Rev. Charles W. Mellen, a Universalist minister at a number Massachusetts churches prior to his death in 1866.</p><p>As a copyist, Mellen created studies and copies of the work of her friend and mentor Fitz Henry Lane. According to Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford, "When [Lane] called at her residence to see the latest copy of [one of his paintings], the [Lane] and the copy were brought down together..." evidently as a lighthearted challenge to Lane, to spot which was his original. As a talented painter in her own right, Mary created numerous compositions of her own as well.  Her paintings include a landscape of the Blood family home (presumably her childhood home), a representative seascape entitled <i>Shipwreck on the Beach</i> (1870s), and a painting that portrays ships at sea as well as a pastoral New England countryside entitled <i>Field Beach (c 1850s)</i>. Like Lane and others associated with the Hudson River artists, Mellen painted in the luminist style popular in mid-nineteenth century America.</p>
<p><b>Isova</b> is a ruined Frankish monastery in the Peloponnese, Greece, which was built after the Fourth Crusade and inhabited by Cistercian monks. </p><p>The two surviving structures, unsignposted, near the modern town of Trypiti show strong Gothic influences.

The archive is located in Bensheim where Ringelband lived until his death. </p>
<p>The <b>House at 502 SE 4th St.</b> is a historic house in Fairfield, Illinois. Built circa 1875, the house's design combines elements of the Italianate and Folk Victorian styles. The house has a balloon frame with a two-story Italianate form. Its roof has both an Italianate hipped shape and tall gables typical of Folk Victorian designs, though the wide eaves and the band board running below them are Italianate. The house's porch and balcony reflect both styles, but its ornamental features are generally confined to the porch, a characteristic Folk Victorian feature. While wood frame Italianate homes were popular in the late 19th century, the house is among the last of its type remaining in Fairfield and is the only one without modern siding.</p><p>The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 2018.</p>

<p><i><b>José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva</b></i>, also known as the <b>Andrada Monument</b>, is an outdoor bronze sculpture of José Bonifácio de Andrada by José Otavio Correia Lima, located at Bryant Park in Manhattan, New York. It is 9 feet (2.7 m) tall and weights approximately 4,000 lbs. Lima was selected through a competition that was sponsored by the Brazilian government, which also donated $60,000 for the surrounding plaza and granite base. The sculpture was cast in 1954 and dedicated on April 22, 1955. Ceremony attendees included Manhattan Borough President Hulan Jack, Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Joao Calos Muniz, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State of Inter-American Affairs Edward J. Spears, Cardinal Francis Spellman, and Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. Originally located at the northwest corner of Bryant Park, it was moved to its current location along Avenue of the Americas, between 40th and 42nd Streets, in the early 1990s. Every September, the Consulate General of Brazil commemorates Andrada and Brazilian Independence Day by hosting a small ceremony at the monument.</p>
<p><b>Robert Francis Boyle</b> (October 10, 1909 – August 1, 2010) was an American film art director and production designer. </p><p>Born in Los Angeles, Boyle trained as an architect, graduating from the University of Southern California (USC). When he lost his job in that field during the Great Depression, Boyle found work in films as an extra. In 1933 he was hired as a draftsman in the Paramount Pictures art department, headed by supervising art director Hans Dreier. Beginning with Cecil B. DeMille's <i>The Plainsman</i>, Boyle went on to work on a variety of pictures as a sketch artist, draftsman and assistant art director before becoming an art director at Universal Studios in the early 1940s. </p><p>Boyle collaborated several times with Alfred Hitchcock, first as an associate art director for <i>Saboteur</i> (1942) and later as a full-fledged production designer for <i>North by Northwest</i> (1959), <i>The Birds</i> (1963), and <i>Marnie</i> (1964). Denied permission to shoot footage on Mount Rushmore, Hitchcock turned to Boyle to create realistic replicas of the stone heads. </p><p>Boyle abseiled down the monument, photographing its contours in detail, before constructing "just enough to put the actors on so we could get down shots, up shots, side shots, whatever we needed." Almost two decades earlier, Boyle had delivered the Statue of Liberty reproduction that was used in the climactic scene of <i>Saboteur</i>.  For <i>The Birds</i>, Boyle was put in charge of the title characters. He later recalled, "We needed to find out which birds we could use best, and finally settled on two types: sea gulls, which were very greedy beasts that would always fly toward the camera if there was a piece of meat, and crows, which had a strange sort of intelligence." Boyle described his relationship with Hitchcock: "It was a meeting of equals: the director who knew exactly what he wanted, and the art director who knew how to get it done."</p><p>When director Norman Jewison failed in his attempts to get the necessary submarine that was at the center of his <i>The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming</i> storyline, Boyle built a working model from styrofoam and fiberglass.</p><p>Boyle's other credits include <i>It Came from Outer Space</i>, <i>Cape Fear</i>, <i>In Cold Blood</i>, <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>, <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>, <i>Winter Kills</i>, <i>W.C. Fields and Me</i>, <i>The Shootist</i>, <i>Private Benjamin</i>, <i>Staying Alive</i>, and <i>Troop Beverly Hills</i>. </p><p>During the course of his career, Boyle was nominated four times for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction, but never won. In 1997 he received the Art Directors Guild's Lifetime Achievement Award, and he was voted an Honorary Academy Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, "in recognition of one of cinema's great careers in art direction," which he received during the 80th Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2008.</p><p>At the age of 98, Boyle became the oldest winner ever of an Honorary Award in the history of the Academy Awards. In ill health and arriving to the ceremony in a wheelchair, Boyle insisted on walking onstage, alongside Nicole Kidman, to receive the honor. He was the subject of the Academy Award-nominated documentary short <i>The Man on Lincoln's Nose</i> (2000).</p>

<p>The <b>Sanctuary of Atotonilco</b> (Spanish: <i lang="es">Santuario de Jesús Nazareno de Atotonilco</i> <small></small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[atotoˈnilko]</span>) is a church complex and a World Heritage Site, designated along with nearby San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. The complex was built in the 18th century by Father Luis Felipe Neri de Alfaro, who, according to tradition, was called upon by a vision of Jesus with a crown of thorns on his head and carrying a cross. The main feature of the complex is the rich Mexican Baroque mural work that adorns the main nave and chapels. This was chiefly the work of Antonio Martínez de Pocasangre over a period of thirty years. The mural work has led the complex to be dubbed the "Sistine Chapel of Mexico." The complex remains a place of worship and penance to this day, attracting as many as 5,000 visitors every week. </p>   
<p>The <b>Lake Agnes Cabin</b>, located 2.5 miles from State Highway 14 near Cameron Pass, near Gould, Colorado, was built in 1925.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.</p><p>It is a 22-by-18.5-foot (6.7 m × 5.6 m) log cabin built of peeled lodgepole pine logs, located about .8 miles (1.3 km) below Lake Agnes, which is in a cirque.  It was used seasonally by park rangers during 1925-2000, and also as a rental cabin years leading up to 2000, and since has been closed.</p><p>It was deemed significant "as a good local example of Rustic style architecture. Rustic style architecture is characterized by its natural setting and its use of native materials, most often log and stone. Designed to blend in with the natural environment, these structures are usually vacation homes, hunting lodges, dude ranches, tourism-related buildings or administrative facilities in national and state parks. The Lake Agnes Cabin reflects the design characteristics with its simple form, log walls, rubble foundation, gently pitched roof with wood shingles, and its exposed log interior."</p>
<p><b>Brigham Academy</b> is a historic school in Bakersfield, Vermont, United States.

<p>  His Majesty's <b>hired armed brig <i>Pitt</i></b> served the British Royal Navy between 1809 and 1812, primarily on the Brazil station. There are no readily available records describing the brig, or her service; Admiralty records in the form of logbooks do exist so original research would provide more information.</p><p><i>Pitt<span>'</span></i>s service predates 1809. On 14 March 1808 <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Foudroyant</i>, and <i>Pitt</i>, of twelve 6-pounder guns and under the command of Lieutenant William Perkins, left Tangiers for Brazil. They reached Funchal Bay on 27 March. There they patrolled the vicinity for three days, looking for enemy vessels, and then sailed for the Cape Verde Islands. For a day or so <i>Agamemnon</i> towed <i>Pitt</i>, which was quite slow. They reached Praia, and then sailed across the Atlantic, reaching Guanabara Bay on 14 May.</p><p><i>Mutine</i>, <i>Mistletoe</i>, <i>Nancy</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> were anchored in the harbour of Buenos Aires on 25 May 1810 during May Week, when the revolution broke out in the city. Captain Fabian of <i>Mutine</i> broke out bunting and the British vessels saluted the revolution with salvos of cannon. Fabian also gave a rousing speech on liberty and revolution, praising the revolutionaries for having gained their freedom. One source gives the name of <i>Pitt<span>'</span></i>s commander as Lieutenant Thomas P. Perkins, but a newspaper account for March 1811 gives it as Lieutenant W. Perkins. On 28 May <i>Pitt</i> sailed to Rio de Janeiro with the news of the uprising. <i>Mutine</i> sailed for Britain with the same news on 3 June. </p>

<p>The <b>John Humphreys House</b>, also known as <b>Sir John Humphreys House</b>, is a historic house museum located at 99 Paradise Road in Swampscott, Massachusetts.  Although it was long thought to be associated with John Humphrey, an early deputy governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, it was more likely built about 1700, based on architectural analysis. In 1641 Deborah Moody bought the Humphrey house (which he called Swampscott) and 900 acres when the Humphreys returned to England giving her over 1300 acres of what would become Swampscott, Massachusetts.  The house was originally located on what is now Elmwood Road (a plaque marks the site), but moved to its current location in 1891 as the Olmsted district was developed. It is currently owned by the Swampscott Historical Society.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.</p>

<p>The <b>Historic Elitch Theatre</b> is located at the original Elitch Gardens site in northwest Denver, Colorado.  Opened in 1890, it was centerpiece of the park that was the first zoo west of Chicago.  The theatre was Denver's first professional theatre, serving as home to America's first and oldest summer-stock theatre company from 1893 until the 1960s.  The first films in the western US were shown there in 1896.  Cecil B. DeMille sent yearly telegrams wishing the theatre another successful season, calling it "one of the cradles of American drama." </p><p>The theatre closed in 1991 and exterior restoration on the historic auditorium was completed in 2007.   Fundraising continues for interior renovations before opening to the public. The vision is to reopen as a year-round multimedia performing arts complex for the community offering education, film, live music, and theatre. </p>
<p><b>Henri Clément Serveau</b>, also known as <b>Clément-Serveau</b> (29 June 1886 – 8 July 1972), was a French painter, designer, engraver and illustrator. Clément-Serveau produced works in a realist manner early on, but soon became interested in the new movements. He was influenced by his friend Louis Marcoussis and experimented with Cubism, utilising geometric patterns to give the illusion of form and space. Later in his career he turned toward abstraction with a post-cubist stance. He designed banknotes for the Banque de France and produced large murals and participated in numerous French and international exhibitions. </p>

Currently, it is part of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, and seat of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Pittsburgh.  This Classical Revival style church building was added to the List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks in 1982.</p><p>Architecturally, the cathedral is described by Walter C. Kidney in his book <i>Landmark Architecture: Pittsburgh and Allegheny County</i> (1985) as:   </p> <blockquote><p>A Grecian Ionic portico, executed in sandstone, is the grand and appropriate introduction to a church that has belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church since 1923.  The exterior, with its big round-arched windows, is not otherwise specifically symbolic, but the interior is rich with paintings and mosaics.  Notable inside are the painting in the dome of Christ the Pantocrator (Ruler of All), with is background of gold leaf, and the iconostasis of metal and mosaic, with peacocks finely depicted on the Royal Doors.  Further art is to be found within the sanctuary, including a painting of the Mother and Child and a fresco of the Last Supper."</p></blockquote> <p>Franklin Toker describes the structure in his book <i>Pittsburgh: A New Portrait</i> (2009) as follows:  <i>"Originally the First Congregational Church, until 1921, this is an unusually vigorous design in yellow industrial brick preceded by a dramatic Ionic portico.  The interior of St. Nicholas should not be missed as an architectural paradigm of America itself: a cool Protestant interior heated up by a blazing iconostasis."</i></p>

<p>The <b>Pryor Brock Farmstead</b> is a place on the National Register of Historic Places just west of Zionsville, Indiana, comprising 4.9 acres (20,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of what was once a 200-acre (0.81 km<sup>2</sup>) farm.  It was placed on the Register, June 27, 2008, due to its role in the agricultural history of Eagle Township, Boone County, Indiana. Pryor Brock Farmstead, with its carpenter's rendering of Italianate architecture, is the best representation of the prosperous agricultural setting around Zionsville/Eagle Township during its time of significance (1870-1920), the "golden age" of Hoosier agriculture.</p><p>The farm was built by Pryor and Emeline Brock.  Pryor was born on January 31, 1823 in Tennessee, and moved to Putnam County, Indiana in 1829 when his father Allen Brock chose to relocate; the family removed to Boone County in 1832. Pryor married Emeline Stoneking in 1846.  It was in 1878 that the Brocks built the house, after some of their older children had already moved out.  By 1880 the value of the land was $10,000 when the county average was $1,180.  Emeline died in 1884, with Pryor eventually marrying an Emma Lemon when he was 68 years old.  Pryor would be 75 years old when he died on October 3, 1898.  The farmstead continued in the Brock family until 2006, when Rosemary Brock Rudwolis died, with a codicil stating the structures on the property should be maintained and preserved.</p><p>The wood-framed main house is a Late Victorian-Italianate structure, with a stone foundation, wood/clapboard walls, and an asphalt roof.  Although well made, the Brock's purposely avoided "urban showiness".  The farmland is one of the few elevated areas of an otherwise flat, featureless countryside.  Partially covered boulders which came to the area as glacial erratics flank the entrance to the property.</p>
<p><b>William Green</b> (1760–1823) was an English artist, poet, writer, and landscape painter, who made images mainly of the Lake District, determined to make them "adhere as faithfully as possible to nature." His biographer, Charles Roeder, stated: "his novel method is notable, as the artists have all a conventional and uniform style in regard to the representation of mountains. Those of Mr Green are veritable mountains; he says that he knows their anatomy and he is undoubtedly right."</p><p>In 1819, Green completed a major work, <i>The Tourist's New Guide to the Lake District.</i> But he became troubled, and by 1820 his constitution was weakened. </p><p>His daughter, Elizabeth, married Walter H Mayson, a famous British violin maker.</p>

<p><i><b>The Misfortunes of Arthur, Uther Pendragon's son reduced into tragical notes</b></i> is a play by the 16th-century English dramatist Thomas Hughes. Written in 1587, it was performed at Greenwich before Queen Elizabeth I on February 28, 1588. The play is based on the Arthurian legend, specifically the story of Mordred's treachery and King Arthur's death as told in Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>Historia Regum Britanniae</i>.  </p><p>Several of Hughes' fellow members at Gray's Inn participated in <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i>’s writing and production. Nicholas Trotte provided the introduction, Francis Flower the choruses of Acts I and II, William Fulbecke wrote two speeches, while Francis Bacon and two others oversaw the dumb show. The play was greatly influenced by Seneca the Younger's tragedies, and was composed according to the Senecan model. The ghost of Gorlois, a duke slain by Uther Pendragon, opens the play with a speech reproducing passages spoken by Tantalus' ghost in <i>Thyestes</i>. All action occurs offstage and is related by a chorus, while a messenger announces the tragic events. W. J. Cunliffe demonstrated the influence of Seneca on Hughes, suggesting the play consists largely of translations of Seneca with occasional original lines.</p><p><i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i> was reprinted in John Payne Collier's supplement to <i>Dodsley's Old Plays</i>, and by Harvey Carson Grumline (Berlin, 1900), who points out that Hughes's source was Geoffrey of Monmouth's <i>Historia Regum Britanniae</i> rather than Thomas Malory's <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i>. </p>

<dl><dd><i>For the eponymous structure in Constantinople, see Church of the Holy Apostles.</i>The <b>Church of the Twelve Apostles</b> (Russian: <span lang="ru">церковь Двенадцати Апостолов</span>) is a minor cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin, commissioned by Patriarch Nikon as part of his stately residence in 1653 and dedicated to Philip the Apostle three years later. It also serves as a part of Moscow Kremlin Museums.</dd></dl><p> Although premises for the Muscovite metropolitan had existed in the Kremlin ever since the 14th century, Patriarch Nikon, who aspired to rival the tsar in authority and magnificence, had them replaced with a much more ambitious residence, centered on a spacious chamber in the form of the cross, once used as a banqueting hall but now serving as a museum of applied arts. To this structure adjoins from the south a domestic church of the patriarchs, originally consecrated to Philip the Apostle until the dedication was altered to the present one in 1682. </p> <p>The church is almost as prominent as neighbouring grand cathedrals of the 15th century, due to its placement upon a high podium, pierced by two large arches allowing passage from the Cathedral Square to the patriarch's courtyard. The exterior walls are decorated with two belts of columned arches which reference both the neighbouring cathedrals of the Cathedral Square and the great churches of the 12th-century Vladimir-Suzdal school which had been their inspiration. The rigorous outline of five helmeted domes, in keeping with Nikon's conservative architectural tastes, serves to accentuate the church's Byzantine pedigree. </p><p>The patriarchal residence was seriously damaged when the Bolsheviks shelled the Kremlin in October 1917. Subsequently, the church was restored in order to accommodate the applied arts museum. Very little subsists of its original murals, yet there is a delightful 17th-century iconostasis, salvaged from the Ascension Convent cathedral upon its demolition by the Bolsheviks and displaying many fine old icons, notably those by Fyodor Zubov and Simon Ushakov. </p>  <p><span></span> </p>

Two years later, he received an Ivor Novello award for the song, which Cliff Richard released it as a single.</p><p>Throughout the eighties and nineties he directed a series of pop and rock compilation musicals for Bill Kenwright.</p><p>In 1998, television production company Celador, for whom he had written the themes for <i>The Detectives</i> and <i>Talking Telephone Numbers</i>, called upon him to supply some music at short notice for a quiz show called <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>. They needed someone to rearrange the pop song that Pete Waterman had written for it. Celador's brief required "something dramatic and full of tension", so Strachan set upon composing a new piece altogether. Working with his son Matthew, he took inspiration from a dissonant chord in Holst’s <i>The Planets</i> suite. The show's huge domestic and international success means that the composition has made them millionaires. In 2002, Keith and Matthew Strachan  were given an award by ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) for the <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i> theme.</p><p>He also created the West End hit <i>Dancing in the Streets</i>.</p>

<p><b>Jacob Bunel</b> (1558–1614) was a French painter. The son and pupil of François Bunel, he was born at Blois. He studied at Rome under Federigo Zuccaro, and on returning to France was made painter to the king, and worked with Pourbus and Toussaint du Breuil in the small gallery of the Louvre, burnt in 1661.

She wrote an autobiography (<i>My Life's History</i>), won numerous awards, and was awarded two honorary doctoral degrees. </p><p>The <i>New York Times</i> said of her: "The simple realism, nostalgic atmosphere and luminous color with which Grandma Moses portrayed simple farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She was able to capture the excitement of winter's first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous gray eyes and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild."</p><p>She was a live-in housekeeper for a total of 15 years, starting at 12 years of age. One of her employers noticed her appreciation for their prints made by Currier and Ives, and they supplied her with art materials to create drawings. Moses and her husband began their married life in Virginia, where they worked on farms. In 1905, they returned to the Northeastern United States and settled in Eagle Bridge, New York. The couple had ten children, five of whom survived infancy. She expressed an interest in art throughout her life, including embroidery of pictures with yarn, until arthritis made this pursuit too painful. </p>

<p><b>Egyptian Revival architecture in the British Isles</b>  is a survey of motifs derived from Ancient Egyptian sources occurring as an architectural style. Egyptian Revival architecture is comparatively rare in the British Isles. Obelisks start appearing in the 17th century, mainly as decorative features on buildings and by the 18th century they started to be used in some numbers as funerary or commemorative monuments. In the later 18th century, mausoleums started to be built based on pyramids, and sphinxes were used as decorative features associated with monuments or mounted on gate piers. The pylon, a doorway feature with spreading jambs which support a lintel, also started to be used and became popular with architects. </p><p>As a result of the Napoleonic conquest of Egypt in 1798, more accurate records became available to architects and Egyptian Revival became a recognised architectural style.  As the 19th century progressed Egyptian features were, on occasions, used for industrial buildings and particularly for suspension bridges, and after 1830 the Egyptian Revival style was often used for cemetery buildings and monuments in cemeteries. Some examples of churches and synagogues exist in this style. </p><p>By the end of the 19th century, the style had very nearly disappeared, but in 1922 with Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb the style underwent a dramatic revival it was used particularly for cinema architecture and sometimes for factory buildings. The angular shapes of Egyptian architecture could be mixed with those of Art Deco, leading to a hybrid Art Deco style which appeared in the 1930s. Subsequently, there have been very few buildings in Egyptian Revival style. </p>

<p><i><b>Virgin and Child with Saints</b></i>, is a large mid-15th century oil-on-oak altarpiece by the early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The work is lost since at least the 17th century, known only through  three surviving fragments and drawing of the full work in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum by a follower of van der Weyden. The drawing is sometimes attributed to the Master of the Drapery Studies. </p><p>The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ-child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalen's robes. This suggests that the Magdalen panel was the first to be cut from the larger work. </p><p>The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438". Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by Robert Campin. He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's <i>Werl Altarpiece</i>.</p>

The casket is densely decorated with knife-cut narrative scenes in flat two-dimensional low-relief and with inscriptions mostly in Anglo-Saxon runes.  Generally reckoned to be of Northumbrian origin, it is of unique importance for the insight it gives into early Anglo-Saxon art and culture.  Both identifying the images and interpreting the runic inscriptions has generated a considerable amount of scholarship.</p><p>The imagery is very diverse in its subject matter and derivations, and includes a single Christian image, the Adoration of the Magi, along with images derived from Roman history (Emperor Titus) and Roman mythology (Romulus and Remus), as well as a depiction of at least one legend indigenous to the Germanic peoples: that of Weyland the Smith.  It has also been suggested that there may be an episode from the Sigurd legend, an otherwise lost episode from the life of Weyland's brother Egil, a Homeric legend involving Achilles, and perhaps even an allusion to the legendary founding of England by Hengist and Horsa. </p><p>The inscriptions "display a deliberate linguistic and alphabetic virtuosity; though they are mostly written in Old English and in runes, they shift into Latin and the Roman alphabet; then back into runes while still writing Latin".

<p><b>Hotel Valley Ho</b> is a historic hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the <b>Valley Ho</b> and, for 28 years, the <b>Ramada Valley Ho</b>, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed, and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of guest rooms extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built. </p><p>The property was bought by the Ramada hotel chain in 1973, and was redecorated to cover the 1950s design, seen at the time as outdated. No longer in vogue, but centrally located, the hotel remained prominent for years, and hosted conferences, business meetings, and vacationers. Under Ramada management, however, the property began to show a lack of maintenance, and its popularity declined. It closed in 2001 and its demolition was considered when no purchase offers were received. Admirers of the hotel's exemplary architecture and its local history rallied to save it, and it was placed on the Scottsdale Historic Register.</p><p>In 2002, the hotel was bought by Westroc Hotels &amp; Resorts and underwent a renovation, which was completed in 2005. Conceived anew by the architectural firm Allen+Philp, a seven-story tower with guest rooms and condominiums was built above the lobby, in the spirit of Varney's proposal. New restaurants were incorporated, including a retro-chic seasonal-American restaurant (ZuZu), and a Trader Vic's franchise at the northeast end of the property (closed in 2011). The hotel's original jet-age design was restored as much as possible, augmented with 2000s-era fixtures. </p><p>The Hotel Valley Ho is a AAA "Four Diamond Award" winner and a member of "Preferred Hotels &amp; Resorts". Author and architect Alan Hess called the hotel "one of the best-preserved mid-century hotels in the country".</p>

<p>The <b>Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array</b> (<b>VLA</b>) is a centimeter-wavelength radio astronomy observatory located in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, ~50 miles (80 km) west of Socorro. The VLA comprises twenty-seven 25-meter radio telescopes deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission. </p><p>The VLA stands at an elevation of 6970 ft (2124 m) above sea level.

<p><i><b>The Descent from the Cross</b></i> (or <i><b>Deposition of Christ</b></i>, or <i><b>Descent of Christ from the Cross</b></i>) is a panel painting by the Flemish artist Rogier van der Weyden created c. 1435, now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. The crucified Christ is lowered from the cross, his lifeless body held by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. </p><p>The c. 1435 date is estimated based on the work's style, and because the artist acquired wealth and renown around this time, most likely from the prestige this work allowed him. It was painted early in his career, shortly after he completed his apprenticeship with Robert Campin and shows the older painter's influence, most notable in the hard sculpted surfaces, realistic facial features and vivid primary colours, mostly reds, whites and blues. The work was a self-conscious attempt by van der Weyden to create a masterpiece that would establish an international reputation. Van der Weyden positioned Christ's body in the T-shape of a crossbow to reflect the commission from the Leuven guild of archers (Schutterij) for their chapel <i lang="nl" title="Dutch language text">Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-van-Ginderbuiten</i> (<i lang="fr" title="French language text">Notre-Dame-hors-les-Murs</i>). </p><p>Art historians have commented that this work was arguably the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion, and that it was copied and adapted on a large scale in the two centuries after its completion. The emotional impact of the weeping mourners grieving over Christ's body, and the subtle depiction of space in van der Weyden's work have generated extensive critical comments, one of the most famous being, that of Erwin Panofsky: "It may be said that the painted tear, a shining pearl born of the strongest emotion, epitomizes that which Italian most admired in Early Flemish painting: pictorial brilliance and sentiment".</p>

<p>The <b>Wieboldt-Rostone House</b> is a house that was built in 1933. Framed in steel and clad with an artificial stone called Rostone (Limestone, shale and alkali). Billed as never needing repairs, it only lasted until the 1950s.</p><p>Intended to showcase a new building material of limestone waste and shale, the Rostone House was the product of Rostone, Inc., of Lafayette, Indiana, and the Indiana Bridge Company.  Construction was simplified by the completion of most design and fabrication work at a factory. The panels would be precast to the correct sizes needed for a specific project. Each panel came with pre-set nuts, that would be used to bolt the panel onto the steel frame. Both the interior and exterior walls were designed this way.  The house was designed by Indiana Architect Walter Scholer. </p>

<p>The <b>Aurora Public Library</b> was first organized by voluntary contributions. When the town was incorporated in 1819 a lot on Fifth Street (then called Literary Street) was set aside for a public library, but it took time for enough funds to be raised for its establishment.</p><p>In 1882 fundraising by the sale of stock in the library property was done in $5 per share for 141 shares, subscribed by 51 people, and the sale of the library lot for another $700 raising $1,405. Non-shareholders could access the library for $1.50 a year.</p><p>In 1901 the library with its 3,500 volumes and "several current magazines" was transferred to the city, and opened in two "well lighted rooms" in the city building three afternoons and two evenings per week with an annual circulation totaling 11,000. It was funded with a 3 cent tax per $100 in property value ($370 per year) supplemented by donations of books and money. A 1904 account stated that under its board selected by the city council "Aurora now has a good, free, public library operating under a very favorable law and there is no reason why, fostered as it is, it should not fulfill the expectations of the liberal minded founders of the city who planned for a community where culture would be general and where ignorance should have no place." </p><p>The current Aurora Library building was constructed by the Cincinnati architectural firm of Garber &amp; Woodward in 1913-1914, with a small rear addition designed by the same firm and added in 1923. It is a one-story, "T" plan, Renaissance Revival style red brick building on a raised basement.  It has a low hipped roof, round arched openings, and terra cotta ornament.</p><p>It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.  It is located in the Downtown Aurora Historic District. </p><p>The Aurora Public Library operates today as the Aurora Public Library District.

<p>The <b>Moses Fowler House</b> is located at the corner of 10th and South Streets in Lafayette, Indiana. The Fowler house is considered the finest example of a large Gothic Revival residence still standing in the United States. Upon his death in 1889, Fowler had accumulated a fortune of several million dollars. Moses Fowler and his wife Eliza were donors to various community interests including Purdue University. Eliza Fowler Hall (razed) at Purdue University was named in honor of Eliza Fowler.</p>  <p>The house was built by Moses Fowler in 1851-1852. Locally harvested Black Walnut and White Oak were used for the ornately carved woodwork. Italian immigrant craftsmen were brought via the Wabash and Erie Canal from New York City to execute the elaborate decorative plaster work ceilings in the large north and south parlors. When completed it was one of the finest houses in Indiana. The designs for the house were principally taken from a copy of A.J. Downing’s book The Architecture of Country Houses c.1851 which Moses purchased while on a business trip in New York City. </p><p>Fowler originally came to Lafayette in 1839 from Circleville, Ohio with his friend and business partner John Purdue (founder of Purdue University) and engaged in the dry goods business. Over the years a  number of business pursuits made him very wealthy. These included the wholesale business, cattle ranching, the railroads, and banking, At his death in 1889, Fowler had accumulated a fortune of several million dollars. Following his death, his wife Eliza was a generous donor to various community interests including Purdue University. Eliza Fowler Hall (razed) at Purdue University was named in her honor.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>In 1902, Moses Fowler’s grandson, Cecil G. Fowler, inherited the house and he and his wife Louise made it their residence. Cecil had followed his father and grandfather into banking but was also a developer. He partnered with Carl Fischer (developer of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway) to build the first luxury hotel in Miami Beach, Florida, which opened on New Year's Eve 1920. In 1916-17, the Fowlers moved out of the house while significant renovations and additions were completed. During this time a large Tudor style formal dining room and living room were added, along with an indoor kitchen, laundry, garage, and servants quarters. The upstairs now included seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. These included a new guest bedroom, master suite, and servants bedrooms. Outside, a large Italian style tiered patio with fountains, a reflecting pool, a tea house, and formal gardens were added. The Fowlers loved to entertain and were well known locally for the large and extravagant parties they hosted. In 1940, with their children grown, the Fowlers sold the house to the Tippecanoe County Historical Association. </p>  <p>From 1940 until 2015, the Moses Fowler House was the home of the Tippecanoe County Historical Association and used at various times as a museum, offices, and for collections storage. </p>  <p>In 2015, The 1852 Foundation (a 501c3 non-profit public charity) was founded through the generosity of Matt and Dr. Ann Jonkman. The 1852 Foundation purchased the Fowler House Mansion and from 2015-2018 completed over $1.3 million in restorations, repairs, code updates, and facility additions in order that the house could be open to and used by the  public for tours and as an events venue.

<p><i><b>Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba</b></i> is an oil painting by Claude Lorrain (born Claude Gellée, traditionally known as Claude), in the National Gallery, London, signed and dated 1648. The large oil on canvas painting was commissioned by Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duc de Bouillon, general of the Papal army, together with Claude's <i>Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca</i>. It depicts the departure of the Queen of Sheba to visit to King Solomon in Jerusalem, described in the tenth chapter of the First Book of Kings.  A more usual subject would be their meeting; this is one of many harbour scenes painted by Claude. The Queen is departing from a city with classical buildings, with the early morning sun lighting the sea, as vessels are loaded. </p><p>The composition draws the eye to a group of people on the steps to the right, at the intersection of a line of perspective (the steps) and a strong vertical (the left column of the building's portico).  The Queen wears a pink tunic, royal blue cloak, and golden crown, and is about to board a waiting launch to take her to her ship – perhaps the ship partially concealed by the pillars to the left, or the one further out to sea, over the picture's vanishing point.   </p><p>The painting was one of the first works to be acquired by the National Gallery in 1824, being one of five works by Claude Lorrain bought from the collection of John Julius Angerstein.

<p><i><b>Alfonso d'Avalos Addressing his Troops</b></i> (Spanish: <i>Alocución del Marqués del Vasto</i>) is a portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos by Titian, painted in around 1540 and now held at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquise del Vasto, was a noble Neapolitan, descended from a family of Castilian origin. He participated in the Battle of Pavia and the conquest of Tunis in 1535. In 1538 he was appointed governor of Milan. Military failures caused a subsequent falling out of favor with the Emperor Charles V.</p><p>This work is both a portrait of the Marquis del Vasto and a picture of history narrating an incident that occurred in 1537. The Spanish troops stationed in Milan began an attempted mutiny over not receiving their pay, but the conflict was suppressed by the Marquis' eloquent speech to the men that inspired loyalty and guaranteed their pay given patience. He, having to leave for affairs elsewhere, left his son with the troops as a guarantee they would be paid.</p><p>The marquis contracted Titian to paint the scene, depicting his son as a page holding his helmet for him during the speech. The composition is based on classical models, such as the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine and numerous Numismatic works. Titian features the General in an elevated position, addressing his men, and emphasizing his words, as advised classical oratory manuals, with elevation of the right arm.</p><p>The work was commissioned in 1539 by the Marquis himself, during a trip to Venice. His first public exhibition was in Milan during 1541, taking advantage of the visit of Emperor Charles. It was subsequently acquired by the Gonzaga family, the Dukes of Mantua, and finally by King Charles I of England. When this King was executed his assets were auctioned, and the painting (like others of the same king) was acquired by Philip IV of Spain. In 1828 Fernando VII ceded it to the collection to the Museo del Prado.</p>
<p><b>Interactive architecture</b> refers to the branch of architecture which deals with buildings featuring the trio of sensors, processors and effectors, embedded as a core part of its nature and functioning. Interactive architecture encompasses building automation but goes beyond it by including forms of interaction engagements and responses that may lay in pure communication purposes as well as in the emotive and artistic realm, thus entering the field of Interactive art. <b>Interactive architecture</b> part of the Internet of things, a term first coined by <b>Kevin Ashton of Procter &amp; Gamble, later MIT's Auto-ID Center, in 1999</b>, can include both interior and exterior elements. Within the interior, many technologies are competing to see who will emerge as the dominant communicative signal. 4GLTE LTE (telecommunication) being replaced eventually by 5G, is the obvious solution, however Visible light communication or Li-Fi, a term first introduced by <b>Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh</b>, is gaining ground as research into this type of data transfer method increases. <b>Interactive architecture</b> and designing our buildings with this technology embedded in it, is essential in the development of <b>smart cities</b>. </p><p>Another essential element in the development of a Smart city is the Landscape architecture. The space in-between buildings used by the public, or the public realm as it is more commonly termed. There are two levels of communication within the public realm and the difference between the two are commonly accepted as the differentiation between IoT and IoE. IoE, or The Internet of Everything, was a phrase first used by Cisco in an attempt to achieve polarity with competitors that had embraced the term IoT. In Cisco's definition however, they highlighted one main difference between IoT and IoE. This difference being interaction with the human node. </p><p>The two public realm communication protocols that make that space a smart space are: </p><p><b>The Intelligent Realm, i-realm.</b> Defined as a realm designed with embedded <b>information and communication technology</b>, which allows the silo elements of that space, lighting, ventilation, traffic signals, transportation, waste management, to communicate with one another for the purpose of making that urban area more efficient and effective. </p><p>The second communication protocol is <b>The Interactive Realm</b>. Defined as incorporating all of the technology needed to create an intelligent realm but in addition, using communication methods such as Global Positioning System, Geo-fence, Near-field communication' and embedded Bluetooth Low Energy, to allow communication between the architecture of the space and the consumers of it. Sometimes referred to as the <b>physical web</b> by Google, an interactive realm uses exterior <b>lighting, bollards, street furniture</b>, bus stops and other elements to communicate to the public via their Smartphone or tablet.  </p><p>Whilst IoT concerns itself with communication between objects in order to make the design more efficient and interactive from an operational stand point. IoE in addition also incorporates communication between embedded objects and user devices.

He is noted for his innovative use of drawing media and for devising the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism and pointillism. Seurat's artistic personality was compounded of qualities which are usually supposed to be opposed and incompatible: on the one hand, his extreme and delicate sensibility; on the other, a passion for logical abstraction and an almost mathematical precision of mind.

<p><b>Jacques-Laurent Agasse</b> (April 24, 1767 – December 27, 1849) was an animal and landscape painter from Switzerland. </p><p>Born at Geneva, Agasse studied in the public art school of that city. Before he turned twenty he went to Paris to study in veterinary school to make himself fully acquainted with the anatomy of horses and other animals. He seems to have subsequently returned to Switzerland. The <i>Tübinger Morgenblatt</i> (1808, p. 876) says that "Agasse, the celebrated animal painter, now in England, owed his fortune to an accident. About eight years ago, he being then in Switzerland, a rich Englishman (George Pitt, later Lord Rivers) asked him to paint his favourite dog (greyhound) which had died. The Englishman was so pleased with his work that he took the painter to England with him." </p><p>Nagler says that he was one of the most celebrated animal painters at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century. In Johann Georg Meusel's <i>Neue Miscellaneen</i> (viii. 1052 et seq.), he compares Agasse and Wouwermans, wholly in favour of the former. In that partial article much is said of his extreme devotion to art, of his marvelous knowledge of anatomy, of his special fondness for the English racehorses, and his excellence in depicting them. He appears first in the Academy catalogues in 1801 as the exhibitor of the 'Portrait of a Horse', and continued to exhibit more or less until 1845 (contradicting Nagler's statement that he died "about" 1806). </p><p>In the catalogues his name is given as J.L. Agasse or Agassé. The number of times Agassé changed his address confirms Redgrave's assertion that "he lived poor and died poor". The writer of the panegyric already quoted says, however, that he did not work for money, but that he was urged forward by the resistless force of natural genius. </p><p>He is also featured in the French thriller <i>L'Antiquaire</i>, with some works credited to him—a painting of two Leopards, among others. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Caernarfon Castle</b> (Welsh: <i lang="cy">Castell Caernarfon</i>), often anglicized as <b>Carnarvon Castle</b>, is a medieval fortress in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, north-west Wales cared for by Cadw, the Welsh Government's historic environment service. There was a motte-and-bailey castle in the town of Caernarfon from the late 11th century until 1283 when King Edward I of England began replacing it with the current stone structure. The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. There was a deliberate link with Caernarfon's Roman past and the Roman fort of Segontium is nearby. </p><p>While the castle was under construction, town walls were built around Caernarfon. The work cost between £20,000 and £25,000 from the start until the end of work in 1330. Despite Caernarfon Castle's external appearance of being mostly complete, the interior buildings no longer survive and many of the building plans were never finished. The town and castle were sacked in 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn led a rebellion against the English. Caernarfon was recaptured the following year. During the Glyndŵr Rising of 1400–1415, the castle was besieged. When the Tudor dynasty ascended to the English throne in 1485, tensions between the Welsh and English began to diminish and castles were considered less important. As a result, Caernarfon Castle was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. Despite its dilapidated condition, during the English Civil War Caernarfon Castle was held by Royalists, and was besieged three times by Parliamentarian forces. This was the last time the castle was used in war. Caernarfon Castle was neglected until the 19th century when the state funded repairs. In 1911, Caernarfon Castle was used for the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and again in 1969. It is part of the World Heritage Site "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd".</p>
<p><b>Edouard Jean Marie Manduau</b> (1855-1938) was a Belgian landscape painter and watercolorist best known for his work in the Congo Free State and the countryside around Brussels. </p><p>Manduau was born in Ixelles, and studied in art academies in London and Brussels (1871), where he was a classmate and friend of James Ensor. In 1884 he joined the International Association of the Congo, where he led expeditions and public works projects. His drawings and paintings, about 70 in number, created a valuable record of the Congo and its people; when in 1885 they were exhibited at Brussels, he was widely acclaimed. However, in protest at some of the "civilizing methods" practiced in the Congo, he resigned and returned to Belgium, where he worked for the opposition newspaper <i>Le Moniteur du Congo</i>. He exhibited at the <i>Salon des Artistes congolais</i> in 1933. Manuau died in Nieuwpoort, Belgium, in 1938. His works are displayed at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren. </p>

<p>The <b>Intel Core microarchitecture</b> (previously known as the <b>Next-Generation Micro-Architecture</b>) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It is based on the Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture, introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. The high power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture never reached the clock speeds of the Netburst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45 nm lithography; however, after many generations of successor microarchitectures which are developed with the Core as the basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more) Intel managed to surpass the clock speeds of Netburst using the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture which reached a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22 nm lithography and ultimately derives from the P6 microarchitecture through the Core microarchitecture and many other succeeding improvements. </p><p>The first processors that used this architecture were code-named 'Merom', 'Conroe', and 'Woodcrest'; Merom is for mobile computing, Conroe is for desktop systems, and Woodcrest is for servers and workstations. While architecturally identical, the three processor lines differ in the socket used, bus speed, and power consumption. Mainstream Core-based processors are branded <i>Pentium Dual-Core</i> or <i>Pentium</i> and low end branded <i>Celeron</i>; server and workstation Core-based processors are branded <i>Xeon</i>, while Intel's first 64-bit desktop and mobile Core-based processors were branded <i>Core 2</i>. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Amanda R. Block</b> (February 20, 1912 – November 8, 2011) was an American artist. Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Block studied art in Cincinnati, Ohio, and exhibited sculpture at her first national show at the Chicago Art Institute in 1941. Her graduation from John Herron School of Art in 1960, at age 48, marked a return to creative work. Her superb color sense has always been Amanda's trademark. Bright, sensual, engaging, full of movement, her work draws the viewer into its orbit, forcing questions upon us. Her female subjects, no matter how abstract their portrayal, always seem to be real people; and we, the viewer, feel forced to question: who are they, and why do they speak so clearly to us.</p> <p>The figural work of Block, her most accessible, falls between the traditional and the avant-garde, between simple and subtle, between passion and control. Although she became well known for her large abstract landscapes in acrylic and her decorative, colorful lithographs from the middle and late 1970s; ultimately, it is through the figural work that one may truly understand this complex artist.

<p>The Lutheran Protestant Church of <b>St. Reinold</b> (German: <i lang="de">Reinoldikirche</i>) is, according to its foundation date, the oldest extant church in Dortmund, Germany; it is dedicated to Reinold, also known as Renaud de Montauban, the patron of the city. The church was built as a palatine church in the Ottonian era. The present building is a late Romanesque church with  a late gothic quire. St. Reinold's was built from 1250 to 1270, and is located in the centre of the city, directly at the crossing of the Hellweg (a historic trade route) and the historic road from Cologne to Bremen. St. Reinoldi's congregation is a member of the Evangelical Church of Westphalia, an umbrella comprising Lutheran, Reformed and united Protestant congregations. </p><p>Efforts to complete the tower of St. Reinold's were renewed in 1443. After its completion in 1454, it was 112 m (367 ft) tall and was referred to as the "Miracle of Westphalia". The polygonal spire was renovated the first time in 1519. On 24 June 1520, the copper roofing was completed, and on 27 July the spire was added. The apex of the church was now about seven metres higher. In 1562 the pastors and congregations of Dortmund confirmed their adoption of Lutheranism in St. Reinold's Church. In 1661, the tower collapsed after being damaged during an earthquake. The foundation for the new tower was laid 1662, and the building was completed 1701, with a baroque ornament on the top. </p><p>The church was heavily damaged in World War II. Since the reconstruction the tower now bears a hood with baroque features similar to the original one, but increased in height (together with the tower as a whole) to correspond with the increased height of the surrounding modern buildings in the city centre. These features supply a visual and harmonious connection between the original style of the church and its appearance after reconstruction. The tower of St. Reinold's Church (today's height: 104 m (341 ft)) can be visited, up to the first platform by the bell tower. </p><p>On the inside there is a large set of bells, made by the "Bochumer Verein" foundry (total weight: 20 t), built in 1954 with altogether 6 steel bells. Their cost at the time of creation was DM 90,500. The heaviest bell (Pitch: f°) weighing 6.500 kg, and measuring 2.50 m in diameter, is the largest cast steel bell in Westphalia.</p><p>In December 2016, nine neo-Nazis from various German cities who were associated with the Die Rechte right wing group occupied the church steeple and appeared to set off fireworks from it. The members were subsequently taken into custody by police. Neo-Nazi slogans shouted from the steeple through a megaphone were drowned out by the church bells, ordered to be rung by the vicar of St. Reinold's. The illegal occupation of the church's tower was met with disbelief and anger from the church's spokespersons and the vast majority of the public.</p>

<p><b>Vojtěch Kubašta</b> (1914, Vienna – 1992) was a Czech architect and artist. </p><p>Vojtěch Robert Vladimír Kubašta was born in Vienna. His family moved to Prague when he was four years old and he lived there his entire life. He demonstrated his artistic talent at the age of four. He had a great desire to become an artist. His father, however, had different goals for his son. He wanted him to study law. </p><p>Nevertheless, the young Vojtěch persisted with his aspiration to become an artist and, eventually, his father agreed that his son could become an architect. The study of architecture, at that time, was considered more of an artistic undertaking than a technical discipline. Some of the great Czech master painters, graphic artists, and illustrators were lecturing at the Polytech University in Prague. Kubašta graduated with a degree in architecture and civil engineering in 1938. His career as a professional architect was short. From the early 1940s, he worked as a commercial artist, and also as a book designer. His illustrations became increasingly popular. </p><p>When the communist government nationalised the entire publishing industry in 1948, Kubašta had to search for new venues to market his artistic talent. He was involved in designing advertising materials for Czechoslovak products abroad. He created three-dimensional cards that advertised porcelain, sewing machines, pencils, Pilsner beer, sunglasses, and other products. Every Christmas season, he designed and illustrated a new crèche in which he captured the Czech traditional Christmas setting. In 1956, he designed his first fairy tale pop-up book: <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>. Kubašta offered this pop-up book to the Prague-based ARTIA publishing house for publication. ARTIA was a state-owned foreign trade corporation. In 1962, his illustrations were featured in <i>Once Long Ago</i>, a book of 70 fairy tales from around the world. </p><p>During the years that followed, Vojtěch Kubašta's three-dimensional books made him the publishing house's best-known book designer and illustrator. His pop-up books have been published in 24 different languages and 35 million copies have been sold. Today, original editions of his illustrations and books are sought after by collectors from around the world.</p><p>The exhibition of his work in the Gallery in the Grove is the first time that Vojtěch Kubašta's original artwork had been viewed by the Canadian public. His magical pop-up books have been displayed in the Toronto Public Library, as a part of Osborne Collection of early children’s books in April 2002. His books have also been featured on <i>Martha Stewart Living</i> and <i>CBS News Sunday Morning</i>. </p><p>Kubašta's first sole retrospective exhibition in North America was organized by the Bienes Museum of the Modern Book in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in February 2005. During a recent exhibition of pop-ups and movable books in Chicago in September 2006, Columbia College devoted its entire gallery to Vojtěch Kubašta's art. The city of Prague sponsored an exhibition of his work in December, 2006. </p>

<p><i><b>Slaughtered Ox</b></i>, also known as <i><b>Flayed Ox</b></i>, <i><b>Side of Beef</b></i>, or <i><b>Carcass of Beef</b></i>, is a 1655 oil on beech panel still life painting by Rembrandt. It has been in the collection of the Louvre in Paris since 1857.  A similar painting is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps Fabritius.  Other similar paintings by Rembrandt or more likely his circle are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.   </p><p>The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example Pieter Aertsen's <i>A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms</i> (1551) and Annibale Carracci's <i>Butcher's Shop</i> (c. 1583), and perhaps more specifically Joachim Beuckelaer's <i>Slaughtered Pig</i> (1563).  Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c. 1635.  Another pre-1655 painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself.  In northern Europe, November was traditionally the time for slaughtering livestock, before winter made feed difficult to find.   </p><p>The painting measures 95.5 by 68.8 centimetres (37.6 in × 27.1 in), and is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1655".  It shows the butchered carcass of a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed.  The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam.  The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs.  The carcass is carefully coloured, and given texture by impasto.  In the background, a woman appears behind a half-open door, lifting the painting from still life into a genre painting, a scene of everyday life.  It is sometimes considered a vanitas or memento mori; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the Prodigal Son, others directly to the Crucifixion of Jesus. </p><p>The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by Joshua Reynolds in the collection of Pieter Locquet in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by Louis Viardot, who sold it to the Louvre in 1857 for 5,000 francs. </p><p>The work's muscular depiction inspired Honoré Daumier, Eugène Delacroix, a series of works by  Chaim Soutine, and Francis Bacon.  Most particularly, Bacon's <i>Figure with Meat</i> depicts Pope Innocent X, as painted by Velazquez, accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting. </p>

<p><b>Girih</b> (Persian: <span lang="fa" dir="rtl">گره</span>‎, "knot") is a decorative Islamic geometric artform used in architecture and handicraft objects, consisting of angled lines that form an interlaced strapwork pattern.  </p><p>Girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by Syrian Roman knotwork patterns from the 2nd century AD. The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional compass and straightedge; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of girih tiles with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 Darb-e Imam shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as templates, and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way. </p><p>The 15th century Topkapı Scroll explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic Penrose tilings, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at Fatehpur Sikri; plasterwork, as at mosques and madrasas such as Hunat Hatun, Kayseri; metal, as at Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo; and in wood, as at the Great Mosque of Cordoba. </p>

<p>The <b>House of Wisdom</b> (Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">بيت الحكمة</span>‎; <i>Bayt al-Hikma</i>) refers either to a major Abbasid public academy and intellectual center in Baghdad or to a large private library belonging to the Abbasid Caliphs during the Islamic Golden Age. The House of Wisdom is the subject of an active dispute over its functions and existence as a formal academy, an issue complicated by a lack of physical evidence following the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate and a reliance on corroboration of literary sources to construct a narrative. The House of Wisdom was founded either as a library for the collections of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the late 8th century and later turned into a public academy during the reign of Al-Ma'mun or was a private collection created by Al-Mansur (reign 754–775) to house rare books and collections of poetry in both Arabic and Persian. Regardless, the House of Wisdom existed as a part of the major Translation Movement taking place during the Abbasid Era, translating works from Greek and Syriac to Arabic, but it is unlikely that The House of Wisdom existed as the sole center of such work, as major translation efforts arose in Cairo and Damascus even earlier than the proposed establishment of the House of Wisdom. This translation movement lent momentum to a great deal of original research occurring in the Islamicate world, which had access to texts from Greek, Persian and Indian sources, as opposed to the "Bookshelf Thesis" that reduces the contributions of Islamicate scholars to mere translation and preservation of Greek texts.</p><p>The House of Wisdom was made possible by the consistent flow of Persian, Arab, and other scholars of the Islamicate world to Baghdad, owing to the city's position as capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. This is evidenced by the large number of scholars known to have studied in Baghdad between the 8th and 13th centuries, such as Al-Jahiz, Al-Kindi, and Al-Ghazali among others,  all of whom would have contributed to a vibrant academic community in Baghdad, producing a great number of notable works, regardless of the existence of a formal academy. The fields to which scholars associated with the House of Wisdom contributed include, but are not limited to philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and optics. The early name of the library, <i>Khizanat al-Hikma</i> (literally, "Storehouse of Wisdom"), derives from its function as a place for the preservation of rare books and poetry, a primary function of the House of Wisdom until its destruction. The House of Wisdom and its contents were destroyed in the Siege of Baghdad (1258), leaving very little in the way of archaeological evidence for the House of Wisdom, such that most knowledge about it is derived from the works of contemporary scholars of the era such as Al-Tabari and Ibn al-Nadim.</p>

The first one was built (1865-1872) by the British Army and the other ones by private businesses (1865-1869).  The costs were almost identical for all three, ranging from 57,600 to 59,762 pounds. </p><p>During the American Civil War, Great Britain claimed to remain neutral in the conflict.

<p><b>"Fort Decker"</b> is a stone house built in 1793 from the remains of the fort of that name.  It is located on West Main Street in Port Jervis, New York, the oldest building in that city, which it predates by several decades. </p><p>The original Fort Decker was built by a Frederick Haynes, a Dutch settler, sometime before 1760, during the French and Indian War, as an unofficial defense and trading post. It was one and a half stories high, built of stone and overlapping logs. Haynes left the area for New Jersey around 1775, leaving the fort to his wife's family, the Deckers.</p><p>On July 19, 1779, during Revolutionary War, when the settlement was known as "Peenpack", the fort was burned during a raid by pro-British Indian leader Joseph Brant. When survivors brought news of the disaster to Goshen, the Patriot attempt to retaliate led to a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Minisink, the only major engagement of the war in the upper Delaware Valley. </p><p>The current house was built from the remains of the fort in 1793. In 1826, it would house engineers working on the Delaware and Hudson Canal, including John Jervis, whom the city would later be renamed for. It remained in private hands as a residence from then on. In 1903, newspapers reported that the original roof was being removed, and in 1924 the building suffered partial damage from a fire.</p><p>As early as the 1880s, there had been interest in using the structure as a museum.

The mosque and theological school (<i>madrasah</i>) is located in the center of the city. </p><p>Agha Bozorgh Mosque was constructed for prayers, preaching and teaching sessions held by Molla Mahdi Naraghi II also known as Mulla Mohammad Naraqi, known famously by his title of <i>Āghā Bozorgh</i> (literally meaning big or great lord) given to him by the Shah himself. Molla Mahdi Naraghi II was the son of the legendary Mulla Ahmad Naraqi (also spelled sometimes as Naraghi) who was the second strongest person in Iran after the king himself, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi is well known for rallying the Iranian forces against the Russian invasion of northern Iran and declaring "jihad" or "holy war" against the invading Russians. He was successfully able to reconquer the Iranian lands that the invading Russian forces had captured during that offensive. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi, his brothers, his sons, and his father Mulla Muhammad Mahdi Naraqi famously known as Muhaqqiq Naraqi; are some of the most prominent Shi'a clerics as well as some of the most famous Islamic Iranian scientists of their time. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi and his father Muhaqqiq Naraqi are especially well known and honored to this day in Iran as the leading Islamic leaders of their time. It being the first time in Shi'a Twelver Islam that the helm of leadership of the faith was passed from father to son. Mulla Ahmad Naraqi was so accomplished in jurisprudence at the time of his father's passing (1209 AH/1795 CE) that it was agreed upon in a general consensus by the other leading figures of the time, to have Mulla Ahmad Naraqi as the next leader of the faith. Muhaqqiq Naraqi and Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's status in society at the time as leaders in both politics, jurisprudence, and faith can best be compared to the power and position held by Popes in the Catholic Church. They were in essence the leaders of the entire Twelver Shi'a world. With Mulla Ahmad Naraqi's passing in 1229 AH/1829 CE he was honored by being interred in the Shrine of Ali. His legacy holds as one of the most important and renowned Muslims in the past 1100 years and one of only a handful of Muslims who have been honored throughout history by being laid to rest in the Shrine of Imam Ali.  </p>

This fountain should be distinguished from the similarly named nearby Triton Fountain (<i>Fontana del Tritone</i>) by Bernini, in the Piazza Barberini, with only a single Triton. </p>   <p>The building, starting from 1610, of the last Roman aqueduct, the <i>Acqua Paola</i>, didn't move to the background the two aqueducts built just a few years before (the <i>Aqua Virgo</i> in 1570 and the <i>Acqua Felice</i> in 1587), which gave the possibility to erect new fountains on the branches that guaranteed a more widespread distribution of water in the whole town. A secondary branch of the <i>Acqua Felice</i> reached the area south of the Tiber Island: here, between ancient and middle-age monuments (the Arcus Argentariorum, the Arch of Janus, the Temple of Hercules Victor, the Temple of Portunus and the basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin) Pope Clement XI ordered the construction of a monument in his own memory. It is not so clear indeed why the pontiff chose to erect a fountain in an area that was scarcely inhabited, broken-grounded and subject to the floods of river Tiber. In fact, its fulfillment raised many criticisms for the location believed to be unhappy. </p><p>The fountain was completed in 1715 by architect Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri, during the works for the accommodation of the square in front of the basilica. The whole travertine structure is placed on a circular step (delimited by 16 little columns joined by a grating), within which the design of the main basin represents an octagon with concave sides, or rather the eight-tips star that was the heraldic symbol of the family of the Pope, the Albanis). In the centre there is a group of rocks (an element that had become popular after the success of the fontana dei Quattro Fiumi) with bushes on which two Tritons (due to Francesco Moratti) are knelt with clinged tails and raised arms, sustaining on their shoulders a big oyster shell serving as upper basin. Between the two Tritons there is the coat of arms of the pontiff. </p><p>Four mascarons formerly dumped water into the main basin; they were removed in the 19th century, probably due to the scarcity of the incoming water, that could have left them dry. In fact the fountain has been without water for a long time, but the hydric provision, though quite scarce, has been restored. </p><p>The last restorations date back to 1994-1995 and 2010. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>   <p><b>Cartwright Hall</b> is the civic art gallery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, situated about a mile from the city centre in the Manningham district. It was built on the former site of Manningham Hall using a gift of £40,000 donated by Samuel Lister and it is named after Edmund Cartwright. The gallery which opened in 1904 initially had a display of artworks loaned from other galleries and private collections until it was able to purchase a permanent collection of Victorian and Edwardian works using money raised by the 1904 Bradford Exhibition.</p><p>Cartwright Hall stands in Lister Park and enjoys scenic views of the city. Cartwright Hall has been held to represent <i>"Bradford Baroque"</i>, a style of architecture typical of Bradford. It is however designed by the same architects as Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (Sir John W. Simpson and E.J. Milner Allen), also in the Baroque style.</p><p>The purpose-built gallery is home to a collection of permanent works, from Old Masters to 20th-century British paintings and sculpture.  Cartwright Hall also has a biennial open exhibition and contemporary and historical exhibitions by local, national and international artists. Since the mid 1980s the Bradford museum group has collected works that are associated with the cultural background of many post-war migrants to the Bradford area. Acquisitions include contemporary South Asian Art - Islamic calligraphy, phulkari style illustrated textiles and items of contemporary Sikh art, including a portrait of Guru Nanak.</p><p>In 1983 Cartwright Hall was briefly used as part of the musical number 'every sperm is sacred' in the Monty Python film, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>.</p><p>In 2003 an Unreal Tournament map was created featuring the inside of the hall as part of a contest for PC Format Magazine.</p>

It structurally resembles a small schoolhouse, which lends credence to the theory. It is surmised to have been built by Captain Calvin Clemence, who died in 1828; the school was operated by a Mrs. Dunbar. In 1901, the house was reported to be occupied by Albert Vinton. Architecturally, the building is a small one story brick structure, three bays long, with a rounded arch doorway at the rightmost bay.

<p class="mw-empty-elt">   </p> <p>The <b>Badami cave temples</b> are a complex of four Hindu, a Jain and possibly Buddhist cave temples located in Badami, a town in the Bagalkot district in northern part of Karnataka, India. The caves are considered an example of Indian rock-cut architecture, especially Badami Chalukya architecture, which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami, the capital of the early Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake ringed by an earthen wall with stone steps; it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times. </p><p>The Badami cave temples represent some of the earliest known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in Aihole transformed the Malaprabha River valley into a cradle of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India. </p><p>Caves 1 to 4 are in the escarpment of the hill in soft Badami sandstone formation, to the south-east of the town. In Cave 1, among various sculptures of Hindu divinities and themes, a prominent carving is of the Tandava-dancing Shiva as Nataraja. Cave 2 is mostly similar to Cave 1 in terms of its layout and dimensions, featuring Hindu subjects of which the relief of Vishnu as Trivikrama is the largest. The largest cave is Cave 3, featuring Vishnu-related mythology, and it is also the most intricately carved cave in the complex. Cave 4 is dedicated to revered figures of Jainism. Around the lake, Badami has additional caves of which one may be a Buddhist cave. Another cave was discovered in 2015, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the four main caves, with 27 Hindu carvings. </p>

<p><b>Shimoda Kikutarō</b><span> (Japanese: <span lang="ja">下田 菊太郎</span>, 2 May 1866 – 26 December 1931)</span> was an architect who created the prototype of the Imperial Crown Style for the Japanese Empire.

<p><b>Murney Tower</b> is a Martello tower in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, whose construction dates to January of 1846. The Tower was built in response to the Oregon Crisis, which was a tense dispute over the border between British North America and the United States in the 1840s. When the tower was first constructed they planned to call it Murray Tower after the Master General of Ordnance. The land however, was owned by the Murney family and was called Murney Point by the locals. They thus began calling the tower, Murney Tower. This name stuck. The original inscription stone above the door read ‘Murray Tower.’ An ‘N’ was affixed over the first ‘R’ so that the current sign reads ‘MURNAY TOWER’, a hybrid spelling of the two versions. </p><p>The Tower is one of five components of the Kingston Fortifications that defended Kingston Harbour, the Naval Dockyard, military supply depot and the southern entrance of the Rideau Canal. Murney Tower complements the fortifications of Fort Henry, Ontario, Cathcart Tower on Cedar Island, Shoal Tower in the Confederation Basin and Fort Frederick on the grounds of the Royal Military College of Canada. In addition to protecting the harbour and approaches to Kingston, these fortifications were designed to concentrate fire on Gardiners Island; it being the only place to effectively land artillery at the time.  </p><p>The Tower stands surrounded by a dry-ditch and is accessible only by a bridge. Murney Tower is constructed of limestone with special brickwork on the barracks and basement levels of the Tower's interior. On the thickest side the walls are about 15 ft. thick at the base and 13ft. thick up top. On the weaker side the walls are about 8 ft. thick. The walls are thicker on the south side because a naval attack from the Americans was the most likely form of attack and thus is what the tower is prepared for. Cannonballs from enemy ships should just bounce right off the walls.  </p><p>The Tower was occupied from 1848 until 1885. The main floor (ground level) was the barracks level where the soldiers and their families lived, ate, and slept. It was manned by the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment until 1870, then by Battery A until 1880, and Battery B until 1884. After 1885 it was watched by the PWOR (Prince of Whales Own Rifles). It could house a maximum of 24 soldiers and one officer or multiple soldiers and their families. Currently, the barracks has two internal carronade cannons fired 32-lb cannonballs directed out shuttered windows. These cannons could be moved about the interior embrasures, and so cover multiple approaches, including the bridge. The lower floor contained the ventilated magazine and storage rooms, along with 4 capponieres, which acted as a defense system for the dry-ditch surrounding the Tower, allowing soldiers to fire through small loopholes at troops attacking the Towers base. The uppermost level is the artillery or gun platform, which supports a Blomefield cannon (which also fired 32-lb cannonballs) that could be rotated along an iron track, thus, providing full coverage around the Tower's entire circumference. Roofs are not original Mediterranean design of Martello towers, but a temporary snow roof was later added to the open gun platform two years after the Tower's construction protects the gun and keeps out the large amounts of snow. The addition of a roof is a common feature on Canadian Martellos. In 1921 a windstorm removed the original wooden roof, and the replacement roof does not allow for rapid removal as originally intended. </p><p>Despite being one of the most sophisticated Martello towers designed and built by the British, Murney Tower quickly became obsolete due to improvements made in military weaponry and ship design.  </p><p>Presently, Murney Tower is a National Historic Site, and is also part of the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications World Heritage Site, managed and maintained by the Kingston Historical Society, which operates it as a military museum during the summer months (Victoria Day Weekend in May — Labour Day in September). Displays include three cannons (32-pounder), period uniforms, muskets, and other mid-19th century military artifacts. </p><p>Although 14 Martello towers were built in Canada, only 9 are still standing, 4 of them in Kingston. Currently, only Murney Tower Museum is open to the public. Fort Henry has two towers that resemble Martello towers, however, they are branch ditch towers. </p>

<p>  The <b>Indian Independence League</b> (also known as <b>IIL</b>) was a political organisation operated from the 1920s to the 1940s to organise those living outside India into seeking the removal of British colonial rule over India. Founded in 1928 by Indian nationalists, the organisation was located in various parts of Southeast Asia and included Indian expatriates, and later, Indian nationalists in-exile under Japanese occupation following Japan's successful Malayan Campaign during the first part of the Second World War. During the Japanese Occupation in Malaya, the Japanese encouraged Indians in Malaya to join the Indian Independence League.</p><p>Established primarily to foster Indian Nationalism and to obtain Japanese support for the Indian Independence Movement, the League came to interact and command the first Indian National Army under Mohan Singh before it was dissolved.

<p><b>Braxted Park</b>, formerly called Braxted Lodge, is a country house in the Queen Anne style set in a landscaped 2,000 acre park near the village of Great Braxted, Essex. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Eudo Dapifer is shown as owner of the manor. All Saints' Church, originally built in about 1115 and restored in the 18th century, also lies within the park grounds. </p><p>The property, recorded as a 'deer park' in 1342, was held by a series of Essex families including those by the names of Anesty, Montchensy, Valence, Hastings, Grey, Montgomery, Ayloff and Maynard. </p><p>The lands were purchased by Thomas Darcy in 1650 from the estate of the then Countess of Pembroke. Braxted Lodge was built on the property in 1680 by Darcy's son. During his ownership, the property was enlarged and landscaped, with several large man-made ponds being added, including one that is now visible from the main house and is referred to as 'the lake'. </p><p>In 1745, the estate was purchased from the Darcy family by Peter Du Cane, Sr. of nearby Coggeshall, a wealthy cloth merchant, trader and businessman descended from noble Huguenot ancestors by the name of 'Du Quesne'. Having moved the family to Essex, where he had become High Sheriff and Member of Parliament for Colchester, Du Cane ultimately settled the family at Braxted Park in 1751. </p><p>Du Cane, a director of the Bank of England and the East India Company, reconstructed and enlarged the house around 1760, assisted by Isaac Ware, Thomas James and Robert Taylor (architect). Du Cane thoroughly landscaped and upgraded the property, more than doubling its size.</p><p>The property passed to Peter Du Cane (II), then 62, when his father died at the age of 90 in 1803. He accomplished even more improvements and alterations to the building and grounds, bringing the main house and gardens largely to their present state. Peter Du Cane (III) inherited the property in 1823 and continued to add to the holdings, including the restoration of the church (including the building of the Du Cane Family crypt) and the addition of several other buildings.</p><p>In 1841, Charles Du Cane acceded to the property on the death of his cousin Peter, who had by then already formally changed its name to 'Braxted Park'. Member of Parliament for Maldon from 1852 to 1854 and for Essex North from 1857 to 1868, Du Cane served as civil Lord of the Admiralty for two years. Sir Charles was appointed Governor of Tasmania from 1868 to 1874 and died on the estate in 1889. </p><p>Braxted Park was acquired by Sir William Boulton, 1st Baronet, from the Du Cane family in 1919. The Boulton Baronetcy of Braxted Park was created in 1944. The Boulton family sold the estate to The Plessey Company in 1947. Sir Allen George Clark, chairman of the company, and his descendants have been its occupants to the present day. </p><p>At present there is a disused Victorian school on the Estate. This was built for the use of the children of the Parish. </p>
<p><i><b>The Feast of Saint Nicholas</b></i> (Dutch: <i><b>Het Sint-Nicolaasfeest</b></i>, c. 1665–1668), is a painting by Dutch master Jan Steen, which can now be found in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It measures 82 x 70.5 cm. The picture, painted in the chaotic Jan Steen "style," depicts a family at home on December 5, the night celebrated in the Netherlands as the Feast of Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas. </p><p>The focal point of the painting is the youngest daughter of the family, a golden-child, painted, in fact, in a golden smock and showing golden locks. She has behaved all year, and Saint Nicholas has rewarded her by stuffing her shoe with a doll and other treats, which she carries in her bucket. She is in stark contrast to her elder brother, standing to her right, who is sobbing, while another brother looks on, laughing. Apparently, the elder brother has been naughty, and his shoe, held up by an elder sister behind him, was left empty. Still there is hope for the sobbing boy. Hidden in the background, almost obscured by the draperies, his grandmother seems to beckon to him—perhaps she is hiding a gift for him too, behind the heavy curtains. While the mother attempts to coax the golden girl to show her the gifts she received, the father, seated in the center of the painting, seems to smile as he remembers his own childhood on this festive night. Further to the right a child can be seen holding a baby and pointing up the chimney, while a younger child looks on in amazement, as he has probably just been told that this was Sinterklaas' method of gaining entry to the house. </p>
<p><b>Harry Herman Roseland</b> (c. 1867—1950) was one of the most notable painters of the genre painting school around the turn of the 20th century.  An American, Roseland was primarily known for paintings centered on poor African-Americans.</p><p>Roseland was largely self-taught, and never traveled to Europe to study art, as did many of the American artists of his time. However, he did receive instruction from John Bernard Whittaker and later, James Carroll Beckwith.  One of his most popular subjects were his paintings of black women fortune tellers who read the palms and tea leaves of white women clients. These paintings were widely reproduced during the early 20th century in the form of postcard sets and large full-colour prints that were distributed as Sunday supplements in newspapers. While known most for his paintings of African Americans, his work encompassed many genres, including seascapes and portraits. He also gained renown for his paintings of laborers in the coastal areas of New England and New York and his many interior paintings. </p><p>Roseland was born and lived his entire life in Brooklyn.  He was a member of the Salmagundi Club and the Brooklyn Society of Artists; in the latter organization he was a member of the executive board.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey has stated that her favorite painting in her personal collection is Roseland's 1904 work, <i>To the Highest Bidder</i>.  This painting, which unlike most of Roseland's pieces is actually a <i>pre</i>-Civil War scene, depicts a mother and daughter who are about to be separated by a slave auction. </p>

<p><b>St. Matthew's Church</b> (Swedish: <i lang="sv">S:t Matteus kyrka</i>) is a protected church located in the Vasastaden district of Stockholm, Sweden. Originally intended to be used as a chapel in the Adolf Fredrik Parish, it was designed by Erik Lallerstedt and built in 1901-1903, at an intersection in Vasastaden.</p><p>The large hall at ground floor was first meant to be used for various charitable activities, as the chapel was located in a poor working-class neighbourhood at the time. The building is reminiscent in many ways of St Peter's Church in Norrmalm, a Methodist church also designed by Lallerstedt in 1899. Some changes were made in 1907–1908, under guidance of the original architect, when the parish was split and the chapel was turned into a parish church.</p>

<p>The <b>Janss Investment Company Building</b>, also known as the <b>Janss Dome</b>, is a historic building in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, in the Westwood Village. The building is located at the five-way intersection of Westwood Boulevard, Kinross Avenue, and Broxton Avenue. </p><p>In 1929 the Janss Dome was the first building erected in the Mediterranean-themed Westwood Village. It housed the headquarters of the Janss Investment Company run by the Janss brothers, Edwin and Harold Janss, who were the developers of the village. The village was built as a shopping and cinema precinct to serve the adjacent University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The second floor of the Janss building was the first male dormitory for UCLA students.</p><p>The Janss Dome was designed by the architectural firm of Allison &amp; Allison, who also designed UCLA’s Royce Hall and Kerckhoff Hall. Architectural features of the building include a high portico and arched windows with the main part of the building having an octagonal shape and being surmounted by its signature dome with its Moorish style aqua and white zig-zag pattern and gold leafing. Atop the dome is a cupola. This dome ranks alongside the white Spanish Revival/Moderne tower of the Fox Theater as an iconic landmark of Westwood Village.  </p><p>Around the beginning of the 1990s renowned architectural firm Morphosis adapted the dome for use as a clothing store by Contempo Casuals, and later it was occupied by a Wherehouse Music store. In 1998 restaurateur Michael Chow remodeled the interior for a Eurochow restaurant but had the time-honored aqua and white zig-zag on the rotunda painted over in white. This caused the Westwood Design Review Board to order that the dome be restored to its traditional decoration. The Janss Dome housed a Japanese restaurant, Yamato, until June 2016, but currently remains vacant.  In 1971, the Paramount Securities Corporation, (Michael &amp; Elliot Lewis), purchased the  property from Bank of America.The property,(Dome section), was leased to Glendale Federal Savings and Loan.A Cupola was placed on the dome,and an original Sir Richard Wallace fountain,dated 1872,(French)was added to the patio. </p><p>The Janss Investment Company Building was dedicated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument on June 21, 1988 (No. 364).</p>

<p><b>Aputheatre</b> ("APU" or "APUT") began life as the <b>Aids Positive Underground Theatre Company</b>. Founded in 1989 at the Sussex Aids Centre in Brighton, England, the objective was to provide a cultural response to HIV and Aids. The company quickly established a reputation for hard-hitting drama very much in the In-yer-face theatre style and a good example of queer theatre. From 1994 onwards, Aputheatre produced work that moved away from being exclusively about HIV-AIDS. Though HIV remained a key subtext in many works, other themes like prostitution, pornography, sexual politics became more important.</p><p>The company’s first production, <i>Crying Celibate Tears</i> by John Roman Baker, was performed as part of the Brighton Festival Fringe. It was an instant hit with public and critics alike and the company was invited to perform the following year as part of the main Brighton Festival programme. This time the play was <i>The Ice Pick</i> and the company won the Festival Award for Best Theatre. The Los Angeles Times called the play "vivid and compelling".</p><p>Several sponsors withdrew funds from the Brighton Festival in protest at the company's inclusion, causing embarrassment within the festival administration and much public outcry. Political controversy often accompanied the company's performances. Politicians in Edinburgh and Forlì, Italy tried to gain votes by calling for theatres' funding to be withdrawn. Printers also refused to print festival brochures.  Even with the company's home base, the Sussex Aids Centre, there was great opposition to the company's work which was considered too strong, too gay and which never followed a politically correct line. </p><p>Aputheatre became Brighton and Edinburgh Festival regulars. Between 1989 and 1997 their work was in many cities in the UK and internationally in Italy and the United States. </p><p>In 1998 Aputheatre’s two founders, John Roman Baker and Rod Evan moved to Amsterdam, where a creative relationship was established with COC Nederland, a Dutch organization for LGBT men and women. The company initially developed four strong plays which explored the sub-culture of prostitution among young East European men living in Amsterdam. <i>The Prostitution Plays'</i>together with a later production <i>Romophobia</i> have charted the evolution and demise of male street prostitution in Amsterdam that has occurred at the beginning of the 21st Century.</p><p>With its establishment on the continent in the Netherlands, the company was able to take its work to other European countries, with tours in Italy, Poland and Ukraine. </p><p>In 2003, the controversial <i>East Side Skin</i> was performed in Amsterdam and Eindhoven. The play explored the attraction of the far right within gay subculture and was inspired in part by the assassination earlier that year of Dutch Populist politician Pim Fortuyn. A DVD of that production was released early in 2004.  </p><p>In 2005, the play <i>Romophobia</i> explored the lives of two Romanians living illegally in Amsterdam, against a backdrop of sexual uncertainty and police harassment. The play highlighted the policy of police to raid gay bars on Amsterdam's Paardenstrat and then arrest, incarcerate and deport young men, with no legal representation. During the run of the play, perhaps as a result of publicity generated around the issue, the Police raids stopped.</p><p>In 2006 with the production <i>Prisoners of Sex</i> author John Roman Baker and Aputheatre returned to their original theme of HIV-AIDS to explores the complexity and compulsions of unprotected sex among men.</p><p>In November 2008 the company announced a new production entitled 'TOUCHED' to be premiered in Amsterdam in December 2008. The production is written and directed by John Roman Baker and performed by Luis Carrión and Richard Morris. </p>

It was built using Colonial Revival architecture as a work of the Office of Indian Affairs, and was expanded, compatibly with the Colonial Revival style, in 1929.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.</p><p>It was deemed significant for its role in "educating predominantly Hualapai but also Apache, Havasupai, Hopi, Navajo, Tohono O'odham (Papago), Pima, and Yavapai children during the early twentieth century", and also "as an expression of Office of Indian Affairs architecture during the 'Assimilation Policy' era, when boarding school buildings in Euroamerican styles were designed to educate Indian children in environments entirely foreign from their own. The architecture expressed the intent on the part of the federal government to separate a student from his or her family and culture and to provide basic skills for earning a living away from the reservation."</p><p>The school operated from 1903 until 1937.

<p><b>Bolshoy Dom</b> (Russian: <span lang="ru">Большой дом</span>, lit. <i>the Big House</i>) is an office building located at 4 Liteyny Avenue in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is the headquarters of the local Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast branches of the Federal Security Service of Russia (FSB) and Main Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p><p>The building is located in the Central District of Saint Petersburg at the beginning of Liteyny Prospekt, one block from the Neva River, at the site of Imperial Russian Old Armoury Building which burned down in 1917. It was originally constructed in 1931–32 for the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU), the secret police of the Soviet Union at the time. The building was designed by Soviet architects Noi Trotsky, Alexander Gegello and Andrey Ol in the late Constructivist style. The Bolshoy Dom building is part of a larger complex which includes the detention facility on Shpalernaya Street, with both gaining notoriety as a prison during the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin. In July 1934, the building became local headquarters of the newly-created People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), when the OGPU was reincorporated as the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) of the NKVD. Bolshoy Dom subsequently became the local headquarters for the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB) when it replaced the NKVD, and remained under KGB usage until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p><p>Bolshoy Dom became the subject of numerous urban legends in Soviet and Russian culture due to its association with the secret police, including all buildings of the FSB being nicknamed Bolshoy Dom. The common conspiracy theory about the building is that it contains a large amount of secret underground floors, leading to jokes about Bolshoy Dom being the tallest building in Saint Petersburg. There is also a legend that the building survived the Siege of Leningrad during World War II because Nazi Germany was aware that German prisoners of war were housed in the top floor, preventing it from being bombed. </p>

<p><b>Giovanni di Giacomo Gavazzi</b>, also called <b>Giacomo Gavasio</b> (16th-century) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance style. </p><p>He was a native of Poscante, in the valley of Brembana. He appears to have trained and worked mainly in Bergamo early in the 16th century, but few records exist. He is the author of five arched panels with figures of the Apostles, and of three paintings in tempera of half-length figures of Saints and Bishops in couples, on a gold ground, in the Lochis-Carrara Gallery in Bergamo. There is also a painting by him of <i>The Virgin crowned by Angels,</i> dated 1512, in the church of Sant' Alessandro in Colonna.</p>

<p>The <b>Asser Levy Public Baths</b>, now part of the <b>Asser Levy Recreation Center</b>, is a historic building located at the corner of Asser Levy Place and East 23rd Street in Kips Bay, Manhattan, New York City. It was named after Asser Levy, one of the first Jewish citizens of New York City, and a strong and influential advocate for civil liberties; it was built in 1904–06 and designed by Arnold W. Brunner and Martin Aiken of the firm Brunner &amp; Aiken. </p>  <p>The baths were an important part of the drive to alleviate sanitary problems in the city.  Many New Yorkers, especially immigrants living in overcrowded tenements, had no place to bathe – an 1896 survey found that there was one bathtub in the Lower East Side for every 79 families – and progressive social reformers pushed for the construction of public bathhouses modeled on those of ancient Rome. In 1895, the state passed a law requiring that localities build public baths, but New York City did not build its first bathhouse, on Rivington Street until 1901.  In 1903, the city's Department of Docks and Ferries released land for a new bathhouse on 23rd Street, which was originally called the East 23rd Street Bathhouse.  The design by Brunner &amp; Aiken in Roman Revival style was inspired by Roman baths and the "City Beautiful" movement as well. The building now houses two  swimming pools, one outdoors for use in the summer, and one indoors for the rest of the year, and a public health club.  It is part of the Asser Levy Recreation Center, which also includes the Asser Levy Playground next door. </p><p>The Asser Levy Public Baths building, which was restored by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1988-90, was designated a New York City landmark in 1974, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The contemporaneous East 54th Street Bath and Gymnasium, at 348 East 54th Street, is also a designated Landmark. </p>

<p>The <b>Nutting Homestead</b> is a historic farm complex on Maine State Route 121, south of the center of Otisfield, Maine.  The property has been owned by the Nutting family and its descendants since the late 18th century, and exemplifies the adaptive use of farm properties over time.  The oldest portion of the farmhouse dates to 1796, and other buildings in the complex date mainly to the 19th century.  The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.</p><p>Nathan Nutting, a native of Groton, Massachusetts, purchased the land for his house in 1796, and built a modest 1-1/2 story Cape style house.  His son, Nathan, Jr., was sent to Boston for education, and he studied architecture and construction.  After his return to Otisfield he built the Federal-style main block of the present house, attaching is father's original Cape to the right side.  Nathan, Jr. is also locally notable as the builder of the Bell Hill Meetinghouse and other area churches, and he operated a sawmill and manufactured carpentry tools.</p><p>The main block of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney. The main entrance is centered on the facade, and features sidelight windows and a louvered fan above.  It is framed by pilasters supporting a pediment and Doric columns and entablature.  The cornice is studded with modillions.  The south (right) side of the house is joined to the 1-1/2 story Cape, which is also five bays wide with a center entrance framed by pilasters.  This section originally had a central chimney, but this was removed in the late 19th century in favor of smaller end chimneys, to which wood stoves were connected.  The overhanging roof suggests that it is also a later 19th century alteration.</p><p>The rest of the farm complex includes three 19th-century buildings: a barn, carriage house, and corn crib.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><i><b>Fountain of the Great Lakes</b></i>, or <i><b>Spirit of the Great Lakes Fountain</b></i>, is an allegorical sculpture by Lorado Taft in the Art Institute of Chicago South Stanley McCormick Memorial Court south of the Art Institute of Chicago Building in the Loop community area of Chicago.  It is a bronze work of art created between 1907 and 1913.  The fountain depicts five women arranged so that the water flows through them in the same way water passes through the Great Lakes.  Note that the Great Lakes waterflow starts in Lake Superior at 600 feet (180 m) above sea level and continues eastward through each lake until it reaches Lake Ontario and then passes into the St. Lawrence River. The Fountain is one of Taft's best known works.</p><p>The fountain was originally installed facing south where it remained until 1963 when it was moved next to the Morton Wing addition facing west where it sits today.  In its original location it was visible from the Jackson and Michigan Avenue intersection once known as "route center" to the south.  The fountain was commissioned by the Benjamin Ferguson fund and one surface references the title <i>B. F. Ferguson Fountain of the Great Lakes</i>.  There is a relief sculpture of Benjamin Ferguson on the rear panel that has been hidden from view since the fountain was moved.</p><p>As the first commission from the Ferguson Fund, it experienced various funding delays.   Additionally, the legal environment for land use in Grant Park was in flux at the time the commission was made, which caused delays in location selection.  Once erected, the fountain received largely positive reviews, but a few critics questioned symbolism of the sculpture.  Others were caught up in sociopolitical subtexts of the day, with regard to obscenity laws as it related to public art and this semi-nude work.</p>
