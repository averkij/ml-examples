<p>The <b>German-based varieties spoken by German Brazilians</b> together form a significant minority language in Brazil. "Brazilian German" is strongly influenced by Portuguese and to a lesser extent by Italian dialects as well as indigenous languages. German dialects are particularly strong in Brazil's South and Southeast Regions. According to Ethnologue, ca. 3 million people in Brazil speak Riograndenser Hunsrückisch, 1.5 million Standard German and 8,000 Plautdietsch. </p><p>German speakers from Germany, Switzerland and Austria make up the largest group of immigrants after Portuguese and Italian speakers. They tended to preserve their language longer than the speakers of Italian, which is closer to Portuguese. Consequently, German was the second most common family language in Brazil at the 1940 census. However, even in areas that are still dominated by German speakers, most are bilingual. Today, German is increasingly cultivated as a cultural heritage, and several municipalities have recently given co-official status with Brazilian Portuguese to one Brazilian variant or another of it. </p><p>Riograndenser Hunsrückisch is the most significant variant, and the term is sometimes used so as to include all forms of Brazilian German. It is particularly well represented in the two southernmost states, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. But especially in Espírito Santo there are significant pockets whose dialect is based on East Low German (East Pomeranian),  and some other dialects can be found locally due to 20th century immigration. </p>

<p>The position of <b>Laudian Professor of Arabic</b> at the University of Oxford was established in 1636 by William Laud, who at the time was Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury. The first professor was Edward Pococke, who was working as a chaplain in Aleppo in what is now Syria when Laud asked him to return to Oxford to take up the position. Laud's regulations for the professorship required lectures on Arabic grammar and literature to be delivered weekly during university vacations and Lent. He also provided that the professor's lectures were to be attended by all medical students and Bachelors of Arts at the university, although this seems not to have happened since Pococke had few students, despite the provision for non-attenders to be fined. In 1881, a university statute repealed Laud's regulations and provided that the professor was to lecture in "the Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee Languages", and attached the professorship to a fellowship at St John's College. </p><p>The standard of the professors has varied. The second professor, Thomas Hyde, is described by the <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i> as a "mediocre orientalist", and one history of the university says of the third professor, John Wallis, that "not only did [he] give no lectures for most of his long tenure, but he did nothing to advance knowledge either." Pococke, Joseph White, Sir Hamilton Gibb, and Alfred Beeston have received high praise for their scholarship. David Margoliouth (professor 1889–1937) taught the syllabus for the final examinations in lectures over two years, forcing some students to tackle the more difficult texts in their first year of study. Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of the reputation of the then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war. Julia Bray, the Laudian Professor as of  2015, was appointed in 2012 and is the first woman to hold the position. She is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, based at the Oriental Institute. </p>

<p>In linguistics, particularly linguistic morphology, <b>bracketing</b> is a term of art that refers to how an utterance can be represented as a hierarchical tree of constituent parts.  Analysis techniques based on bracketing are used at different levels of grammar, but are particularly associated with morphologically complex words. </p><p>To give an example of bracketing in English, consider the word <i>uneventful</i>.  This word is made of three parts, the prefix <i>un-</i>, the root <i>event</i>, and the suffix <i>-ful</i>.  An English speaker should have no trouble parsing this word as "lacking in significant events".  However, imagine a foreign linguist with access to a dictionary of English roots and affixes, but only a superficial understanding of English grammar.  Conceivably, he or she could understand <i>uneventful</i> as one of: </p> <ul><li>"not eventful", where <i>eventful</i> in turn means "full of events"</li> <li>"full of unevents", where <i>unevent</i> in turn means "something different from or opposite to an event" </li></ul><p>We can represent these two understandings of <i>uneventful</i> with the <i>bracketings</i> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle \left[[{\mbox{un-}}]\left[[{\mbox{event}}][{\mbox{-ful}}]\right]\right]}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mrow>           <mo>[</mo>           <mrow>             <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>             <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">               <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                 <mtext>un-</mtext>               </mstyle>             </mrow>             <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>             <mrow>               <mo>[</mo>               <mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>                 <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">                   <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                     <mtext>event</mtext>                   </mstyle>                 </mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>                 <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>                 <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">                   <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                     <mtext>-ful</mtext>                   </mstyle>                 </mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>               </mrow>               <mo>]</mo>             </mrow>           </mrow>           <mo>]</mo>         </mrow>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \left[[{\mbox{un-}}]\left[[{\mbox{event}}][{\mbox{-ful}}]\right]\right]}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle \left[\left[[{\mbox{un-}}][{\mbox{event}}]\right][{\mbox{-ful}}]\right]}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mrow>           <mo>[</mo>           <mrow>             <mrow>               <mo>[</mo>               <mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>                 <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">                   <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                     <mtext>un-</mtext>                   </mstyle>                 </mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>                 <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>                 <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">                   <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                     <mtext>event</mtext>                   </mstyle>                 </mrow>                 <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>               </mrow>               <mo>]</mo>             </mrow>             <mo stretchy="false">[</mo>             <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">               <mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0">                 <mtext>-ful</mtext>               </mstyle>             </mrow>             <mo stretchy="false">]</mo>           </mrow>           <mo>]</mo>         </mrow>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \left[\left[[{\mbox{un-}}][{\mbox{event}}]\right][{\mbox{-ful}}]\right]}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span>, respectively.  Here, bracketing gives the linguist a convenient technique for representing the different ways to parse the word, and for forming hypotheses about why the word is parsed the way it is by speakers of the language. </p><p>Since bracketing represents a hierarchical tree, it is associated to some extent with generative grammar.  Some theories in cognitive linguistics rely on the idea that bracketing represents to some degree of accuracy how listeners parse complex utterances (e.g. level ordering).  In computational linguistics, rules for how a program should parse a word can be represented in terms of possible bracketings. </p><p>It is not completely clear that bracketing accurately represents the structure of utterances.  In particular, there are bracketing paradoxes that challenge this idea.  However, there is some evidence for bracketing, such as the creation of new words via <i>rebracketing</i>. </p>

It has been pointed out that there has only been one successful instance of a complete language revival, that of the Hebrew language, creating a new generation of native speakers without any pre-existing native speakers as a model.</p><p>Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try to revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death. </p><p>Reasons for revitalization vary. In recent times alone, it is estimated that more than 2000 languages have already become extinct. The UN estimates that more than half of the languages spoken today have fewer than 10,000 speakers and that a quarter have fewer than 1,000 speakers and that, unless there are some efforts to maintain them, over the next hundred years most of these will become extinct. These figures are often cited as reasons why language revitalization is necessary to preserve linguistic diversity. Culture and identity are also frequently cited reasons for language revitalization, when a language is perceived as a unique "cultural treasure." A community often sees language as a unique part of their culture, connecting them with their ancestors or with the land, making up an essential part of their history and self-image.</p><p>Language revitalization is also closely tied to the linguistic field of language documentation. In this field, linguists attempt to create full records of a language's grammar, vocabulary, and linguistic features. This practice can often lead to more concern for the revitalization of a specific language on study. Furthermore, the task of documentation is often taken on with the goal of revitalization in mind.</p>

<p>The verbal morphology of the Kagoshima dialects is heavily marked by numerous distinctive phonological processes, as well as both morphological and lexical differences.  The following article deals primarily with the changes and differences affecting the verb conjugations of the central Kagoshima dialect, spoken throughout most of the mainland and especially around Kagoshima City, though notes on peripheral dialects may be added.  Like standard Japanese, verbs do not inflect for person or plurality, and come in nine basic stems.  However, contrary to the standard language, all verbs ending with the stem <i>-ru</i> conjugate regularly as consonant-stem verbs, though irregularities are present in other forms. </p><p>Most notably, the distinction and irregular conjugation pattern of the <i>shimo nidan</i> or "lower bigrade" ending <i>-(y)uru</i>, which corresponds to standard Japanese <i>-eru</i>, is still preserved in the dialect.  However, <i>kami nidan</i> or "upper bigrade" verbs ending in <i>-iru</i> have merged with all other verbs ending in <i>-ru</i>, in a similar fashion to other Kyushu dialects like that of Ōita. </p>

<p>The Celtic <b>Cisalpine Gaulish</b> inscriptions are frequently combined with the Lepontic inscriptions under the term <i>Celtic language remains in northern Italy</i>. While it is possible that the Lepontians were autochthonous to northern Italy since the end of the 2nd millennium BC, it is well-known that the Gauls invaded the regions north of the river Po in several waves since the 5th century BC. They apparently took over the art of writing from the Lepontians, including some of the orthographic peculiarities. There are only about half a dozen Cisalpine Gaulish inscriptions, three of which are longer than just one or two words. The inscriptions stem largely from the area south of the Lepontians.</p><p>There is ongoing debate over whether Cisalpine Gaulish is a dialect of Gaulish (e.g. Schumacher 2004), or a historical or dialectical continuation of Lepontic (e.g. Eska 2010).  In the latter case, the term <b>Cisalpine Celtic</b> refers to the two together, contrasting with <i>Transalpine Celtic</i> (traditionally <i>Transalpine Gaulish</i>) for the Celtic language on the other side of the Alps. </p>

<p><b>Taíno</b> is a poorly-attested Arawakan language that was spoken by the Taíno people of the Caribbean. At the time of Spanish contact, it was the principal language throughout the Caribbean. Classic Taíno (Taíno proper) was the native language of the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and most of Hispaniola, and it was expanding into Cuba. Ciboney is essentially unattested, but colonial sources suggest that it was a dialect of Taíno and was spoken in westernmost Hispaniola, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and most of Cuba. </p><p>By the late 15th century, Taíno had displaced earlier languages except in western Cuba and pockets in Hispaniola. As the Taíno culture declined during Spanish colonization, the language was replaced by Spanish and other European languages. It is believed to have been extinct within 100 years of contact but possibly continued to be spoken in isolated pockets in the Caribbean until the late 19th century. As the first indigenous language encountered by Europeans in the New World, it was a major source of new words borrowed into European languages. </p>

<p><b>Ilie Bărbulescu</b> (December 3, 1873 – June 5, 1945) was a Romanian linguist and philologist who specialized in the Slavic languages, also noted as a political journalist and Conservative Party cadre. Academically trained in his native country and in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, he investigated in particular the Slavic influence on Romanian and the origins of Romanian literature, with additional interests in Old East Slavic and Russian literature. He was a corresponding member of the Romanian and Serbian Academies, and helped establish a Slavic studies department at the University of Iași. Bărbulescu was nevertheless a controversial figure, deeply involved in academic rivalries, and taking up unpopular political stances—especially during World War I, when, contrary to his background in Slavistics, he took up "Germanophilia", rooting for the Central Powers. </p><p>Published by <i>Viața Romînească</i> and <i>Seara</i>, Bărbulescu's political essays caused public outrage by questioning the motives of Romanian nationalists. He was largely silent after declared war on the Central Powers, but returned to prominence after her surrender in April 1918. With a Germanophile triumph apparent, he was elected dean, became editor of the newspaper <i>Iașiul</i>, and served for several months as a Conservative in the Senate of Romania. He was demoted, and narrowly escaped being laid off, following the Armistice of November. Bărbulescu returned to his research, for which he was rewarded with a membership in the Czech Society; he was nevertheless defeated in his bid to become a full member of the Romanian Academy, attributing this failure to political resentments and a Masonic conspiracy. </p>

<p><b>Articulatory phonology</b> is a linguistic theory originally proposed in 1986 by Catherine Browman of Haskins Laboratories and Louis M. Goldstein of Yale University and Haskins. The theory identifies theoretical discrepancies between phonetics and phonology and aims to unify the two by treating them as low- and high-dimensional descriptions of a single system. </p><p>Unification can be achieved by incorporating into a single model the idea that the physical system (identified with phonetics) constrains the underlying abstract system (identified with phonology), making the units of control at the abstract planning level the same as those at the physical level. </p><p>The plan of an utterance is formatted as a gestural score, which provides the input to a physically based model of speech production - the task dynamic model of Elliot Saltzman. The gestural score graphs locations within the vocal tract where constriction can occur, indicating the planned or target degree of constriction. A computational model of speech production developed at Haskins Laboratories combines articulatory phonology, task dynamics, and the Haskins articulatory synthesis system developed by Philip Rubin and colleagues. </p>

<p><b>Livonian</b> (Livonian: <i>līvõ kēļ</i> or <i>rāndakēļ</i>) is a Finnic language. It is a dormant language, with its last native speaker having died in 2013. It is closely related to Estonian. The native land of the Livonian people is the Livonian Coast of the Gulf of Livonia, located in Latvia in the north of the Kurzeme peninsula. </p><p>Some ethnic Livonians are learning or have learned Livonian in an attempt to revive it, but because ethnic Livonians are a small minority, opportunities to use Livonian are limited. The Estonian newspaper <i>Eesti Päevaleht</i> erroneously announced that Viktors Bertholds, who died on 28 February 2009, was the last native speaker who started the Latvian-language school as a monolingual. Some other Livonians had argued, however, that there were some native speakers left, including Viktors Bertholds' cousin, Grizelda Kristiņa. Kristiņa died in 2013. An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. In a 2009 conference proceeding, it was mentioned that there could be "at best 10 living native" speakers of the language.</p><p>The promotion of the Livonian language as a living language has been advanced mostly by the Livonian Cultural Centre (<i><i lang="lv" title="Latvian language text">Līvõ Kultūr Sidām</i></i>), an organisation of mostly young Livonians. Livonian as a lesser used language in Latvia – along with Latgalian – is represented by the Latvian Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (LatBLUL), formerly a national branch of the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (EBLUL). </p><p>The language is taught in universities in Latvia, Estonia and Finland, which constantly increases the pool of second-language speakers who do not constantly reside in Latvia. </p>

<p><b>Hermann Möller</b> (13 January 1850 in Hjerpsted, Denmark – 5 October 1923 in Copenhagen) was a Danish linguist noted for his work in favor of a genetic relationship between the Indo-European and Semitic language families and his version of the laryngeal theory. </p><p>Möller grew up in North Frisia after its conquest by Germany in the German–Danish War of 1864 and attended German universities (Pulsiano and Treharne 2001:447). He began teaching Germanic philology at the University of Copenhagen in 1883 and continued to do so for over thirty-five years (ib.). Also in 1883, he published <i>Das altenglische Volksepos in der ursprünglichen strophischen Form</i>, 'The Old English Folk Epic in the Original Strophic Form', in which he argued, among other things, that <i>Beowulf</i> had been composed in a fixed meter which was corrupted by later poets (ib.). </p>
<p>The <b>West Semitic languages</b> are a proposed major sub-grouping of ancient Semitic languages. The term was first coined in 1883 by Fritz Hommel.</p><p>The grouping, supported by Semiticists like Robert Hetzron and John Huehnergard, divides the Semitic language family into two branches: Eastern and Western. The East Semitic languages consist of the extinct Eblaite and Akkadian languages, while the remaining majority of Semitic languages form the West Semitic languages grouping. It consists of the clearly defined sub-groups: Ethiopic, South Arabian, Arabic and Northwest Semitic (this including Hebrew, Aramaic, Amorite and Ugaritic). The first two, Ethiopic and South Arabian, show particular common features, and are often grouped together as South Semitic. The proper classification of Arabic with respect to other Semitic languages is debated. In older classifications, it is grouped with the South Semitic languages. However, Hetzron and Huehnergard connect it more closely with the Northwest Semitic languages, to form Central Semitic. Some Semiticists continue to argue for the older classification based on the distinctive feature of broken plurals. Some linguists also argue that Eteocypriot was a Northwest Semitic language spoken in ancient Cyprus.</p>

<p><b>Divergence</b> in linguistics refers to one of the five principles by which you can detect grammaticalisation while it is taking place. The other four are: layering, specialisation, persistence, and de-categorialisation. </p><p>Divergence names a state of affairs subsequent to some change, namely the result of the process called "split" by Heine and Reh. "When a lexical form undergoes grammaticalization to a clitic or affix, the original form may remain as an autonomous lexical element and undergo the same changes as ordinary lexical items." (Hopper 1991: 22) A possible formal distinction between divergence and split would be that the latter seems to be confined to cases where one and the same source has several targets, whereas the former merely refers to the drifting apart of previously more similar items. </p><p>The form of a lexical item may undergo different changes from its grammaticalised counterpart. </p>

After World War II, local communist authorities forbade the use of the language, after the expulsion of the Germans the province of Silesia was incorporated into southwestern Poland, with small portions remaining in northeastern Czech Republic and in eastern Germany. Silesian German continued to be spoken only by individual families expelled to the remaining territory of Germany and in cultural gatherings mainly in West Germany. Most descendants of the Silesian Germans expelled to West and East Germany no longer learned the dialect, and the cultural gatherings were less and less frequented. </p>

<p><b>Max</b>, also known as Max/MSP/Jitter, is a visual programming language for music and multimedia developed and maintained by San Francisco-based software company Cycling '74. Over its more than thirty-year history, it has been used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.</p><p>The Max program is modular, with most routines existing as shared libraries. An application programming interface (API) allows third-party development of new routines (named <i>external objects</i>). Thus, Max has a large user base of programmers unaffiliated with Cycling '74 who enhance the software with commercial and non-commercial extensions to the program. Because of this ingenious extensible design, which simultaneously represents both the program's structure and its graphical user interface (GUI), Max has been described as the lingua franca for developing interactive music performance software.</p>
<p>The <b>Cariban languages</b> are an indigenous language family of South America. They are widespread across northernmost South America, from the mouth of the Amazon River to the Colombian Andes but also appear in central Brazil. Cariban languages are relatively closely related. There are two to three dozen of them, depending on what is considered a dialect. Most are still spoken but often by only a few hundred speakers; the only one with more than a few thousand is Macushi, which has 30,000. The Cariban family is well known in the linguistic world partly because Hixkaryana's default word order is object–verb–subject, which had previously not been thought to exist in human language. </p><p>Some years prior to the arrival of the first Spanish explorers, Caribs invaded and occupied the Lesser Antilles and killed, displaced or assimilated the Arawaks who had inhabited the islands. The resulting language was Carib in name but largely Arawak in substance. That was because the invading Carib men killed Arawak men and took Arawak wives, who then passed their language on to the children. For a time, Arawak was spoken by women and children and Carib by adult men, but the situation was unstable. As each generation of Carib-Arawak boys reached adulthood, they acquired less Carib until only basic vocabulary and a few grammatical elements were left. That "Island Carib" became extinct in the Lesser Antilles in the 1920s but survives in the form of Garífuna, or "Black Carib," in Central America. The gender distinction has dwindled to only a handful of words. Dominica is the only island in the eastern Caribbean to retain some of its pre-Columbian population, the Carib Indians, about 3,000 of whom live on the island's east coast. </p>
<p>The <b>North Germanic languages</b> make up one of the three branches of the Germanic languages, a sub-family of the Indo-European languages, along with the West Germanic languages and the extinct East Germanic languages. The language group is sometimes referred to as the "<b>Nordic languages</b>", a direct translation of the most common term used among Danish, Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish scholars and laypeople. </p><p>In Scandinavia, the term "<b>Scandinavian languages</b>" refers specifically to the generally mutually intelligible languages of the three continental Scandinavian countries, and is thus used in a more narrow sense as a subset of the Nordic languages, leaving aside the insular subset of Faroese and Icelandic. Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are also referred to as Scandinavian or Nordic languages, while Faroese and Icelandic are grouped together as Insular Nordic languages. The term <i>Scandinavian</i> arose in the 18th century as a result of the early linguistic and cultural Scandinavist movement, referring to the people, cultures, and languages of the three Scandinavian countries and stressing their common heritage. </p><p>The term "North Germanic languages" is used in comparative linguistics, whereas the term "Scandinavian languages" appears in studies of the modern standard languages and the dialect continuum of Scandinavia.</p><p>Approximately 20 million people in the Nordic countries speak a Scandinavian language as their native language, including an approximately 5% minority in Finland. Languages belonging to the North Germanic language tree are also commonly spoken on Greenland and, to a lesser extent, by immigrants in North America. </p>
<p>The <b>Ancient Greek</b> language includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (Koine Greek, 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD).  It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek and succeeded by medieval Greek. </p><p>Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earliest form it closely resembled Attic Greek and in its latest form it approaches Medieval Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classic and earlier periods included several regional dialects. </p><p>Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of fifth-century Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to English vocabulary and has been a standard subject of study in educational institutions of the Western world since the Renaissance. This article primarily contains information about the Epic and Classical periods of the language. </p>   
<p><b>Sitopayan I inscription</b> is an inscription written in a mixed of Old Malay and Old Batak languages, written mostly using Old Javanese characters with some words using Old Batak characters. The inscription was found at the Biaro (temple) Si Topayan, in Sitopayan village, Portibi District, North Padang Lawas Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. The inscription is quite short, it is written on one of the horizontal sides of a base of a stone idol. F.D.K. Bosch thought that this inscription was made in the 13th century CE, based on the shape and characteristics of the script.</p><p>The inscription mentioned three people named <i>Hang Tahi</i>, <i>Si Rangit</i>, and <i>Kabayin Pu Anyawari</i> who made an idol house. The use of two languages, namely Old Malay and Old Batak, raises the notion that the community around the area was bilingual. In addition, the mentioning of three articles <i>Hang</i>, <i>Si</i>, and <i>Pu (Mpu)</i> in the people names (<i>Tahi</i>, <i>Ranggit</i>, and <i>Kabayin Anyawari</i>) also reflects the characteristic habit of a Malay speaking people.</p><p>Currently, the inscription is stored in the North Sumatra State Museum, with the inventory number 1517.1.</p>
<p>The <b>descriptive fallacy</b> refers to reasoning which treats a speech act as a logical proposition, which would be mistaken when the meaning of the statement is not based on its truth condition. It was suggested by the British philosopher of language J. L. Austin in 1955 in the lectures now known as <i>How to Do Things With Words</i>. Austin argued that performative utterances are not meaningfully evaluated as true or false but rather by other measures, which would hold that a statement such as "thank you" is not meant to describe a fact and to interpret it as such would be to commit the descriptive fallacy. </p>
<p><b>Writeprint</b> is a method in forensic linguistics of establishing author identification over the internet, likened to a digital fingerprint.  Identity is established through a comparison of distinguishing stylometric characteristics of an unknown written text with known samples of the suspected author (writer invariants).  Even without a suspect, writeprint provides potential background characteristics of the author, such as nationality and education.</p><p>There are five broad aspects to author identification in writeprint:   </p> <dl><dd><ul><li>lexical features- The analysis of the lexicon, the author's choice of vocabulary.</li> <li>syntactic features- The analysis of the author's writing style and sentence structure, such as: punctuation, use of passive voice, and sentence complexity.</li> <li>structural features- The analysis of the author's organization of the work.  These include paragraph length, spacing, and indentation.</li> <li>content-specific features- The analysis of the language that is contextually significant to subject of the written work.  Examples include the use of slang or acronyms that are specific to a crime like pirating software or hacking.</li> <li>idiosyncratic features- The analysis of errors and other ungrammatical elements that may be unique to the author.</li></ul></dd></dl><p>While the five features above are the traditional methods of author identification, there are features unique to online text. Features such as choice in font, the use of emojis, and links to other websites all provide a path to identification which is absent in traditional text analysis.</p>

<p><b>Paul William Friedrich</b> (October 22, 1927 – August 11, 2016) was an American anthropologist, linguist, poet, and Professor of Social Thought at the University of Chicago. He studied at Harvard with Roman Jakobson, and received his Ph.D. from Yale under the supervision of Sidney Mintz. He specialized in Slavic languages and literature, and in the ethnographic and linguistic study of the Purépecha people of Western Mexico, as well as in the role of poetics and aesthetics in creating linguistic and discursive patterns. Among his best known works were  <i>Agrarian Revolt in a Mexican Village</i> (1970; 1977), <i>The Princes of Naranja: An Essay in Anthrohistorical Method</i> (1987), both ethnographic works describing local politics in a small community in the Mexican state of Michoacan. And in linguistics his works <i>The Tarascan Suffixes of Locative Space: Meaning and Morphotactics</i> [1971] and <i>A Phonology of Tarascan</i> [1973] were among the most detailed as well as earliest modern linguistic of the Purépecha language. In 2005, his former students honored him with a festschrift titled <i>Language, Culture and the Individual: A Tribute to Paul Friedrich</i>. In 2007 Yale University awarded Friedrich with the Wilbur Cross Medal. A prolific poet he also published seven collections of poems, some of them focusing on the haiku form.</p>

<p><b>Glossolalia</b> or <b>speaking in tongues</b> is a phenomenon in which people appear to speak in languages unknown to them. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases as part of religious practice in which it is believed to be a divine language unknown to the speaker. Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity as well as in other religions. The term derives from <i lang="el" title="Greek language text">glōssais lalein</i>, a Greek phrase used in the New Testament meaning "to speak in or with tongues [i.e., other languages]" (<span>Acts 2:4</span>, <span>1 Corinthians 14:18</span>). </p><p>Sometimes a distinction is made between "glossolalia" and "xenolalia" or "xenoglossy", which specifically designates when the language being spoken is a natural language previously unknown to the speaker. However, this distinction is not universally made, and the New Testament uses the phrase <i>glōssais lalein</i> in at least one passage to refer to speaking in languages known to others but not to the speakers.</p>
<p>Lao is generally a subject–verb–object language, but emphasis can move the object to the beginning of a sentence.

<p><b>Stokoe notation</b> (<span></span>) is the first phonemic script used for sign languages. It was created by William Stokoe for American Sign Language (ASL), with Latin letters and numerals used for the shapes they have in fingerspelling, and iconic glyphs to transcribe the position, movement, and orientation of the hands. It was first published as the organizing principle of <i>Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf</i> (1960), and later also used in <i>A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles,</i> by Stokoe <i>et al.</i> (1965). In the 1965 dictionary, signs are themselves arranged alphabetically, according to their Stokoe transcription, rather than being ordered by their English glosses as in other sign-language dictionaries. This made it the only ASL dictionary where the reader could look up a sign without first knowing how to translate it into English. The Stokoe notation was later adapted to British Sign Language (BSL) in Kyle et al. (1985) and to Australian Aboriginal sign languages in Kendon (1988). In each case the researchers modified the alphabet to accommodate phonemes not found in ASL. </p><p>The Stokoe notation is mostly restricted to linguists and academics. The notation is arranged linearly on the page and can be written with a typewriter that has the proper font installed. Unlike SignWriting or the Hamburg Notation System, it is based on the Latin alphabet and is phonemic, being restricted to the symbols needed to meet the requirements of ASL (or extended to BSL, etc.) rather than accommodating all possible signs.

<p>The <b>Questione Ladina</b> is a scientific debate about how to categorise several Romance languages or dialects that are spoken in the Alps. Basically, it is dealing with the question of whether Romansh, Ladin and Friulian form a proper language subfamily or if they should be regarded as a part of a wider Northern Italian dialect continuum. </p>
<p><b>Symbolic communication</b> is exchange of messages that change <i>a priori</i> expectation of events. Examples of this are modern communication technology and the exchange of information amongst animals.  By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in our current state of modernity. </p>
<p> The <b>World Sanskrit conference</b> is an international conference organised at various locations globally. It has been held in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The Delhi International Sanskrit Conference of 1972 is considered to be the first World Sanskrit Conference. So far it has been held in India four times (1972,1981,1997,2012).</p>
<p>In linguistics, the term <b>near-native speakers</b> is used for people who are "highly proficient speakers who are distinguishable from native speakers, but only in small ways." Analysis of native and near-native speakers indicates that they differ in their underlying grammar and intuition, meaning that they do not interpret grammatical contrasts the same way. However, this divergence typically does not impact a near-native speaker's regular usage of the language.</p>

<p><b>Endophora</b> refers to the phenomenon of expressions that derive their reference from something within the surrounding text (endophors).</p><p>For example, in the sentences "I saw Sally yesterday. She was lying on the beach", "she" is an <i>endophoric</i> expression because it refers to something mentioned elsewhere in the text, i.e. "Sally". </p><p>By contrast, "She was lying on the beach," if it appeared by itself, contains an <i>exophoric</i> expression; "she" refers to something that is not present in the surrounding text, so there is not enough information given within the text to independently determine to whom "she" refers. It can refer to someone the speaker assumes his audience has prior knowledge of, or it can refer to a person he is showing to his listeners. Without further information, in other words, there is no way of knowing the exact meaning of an exophoric term. </p><p>Endophora can be broken into three subcategories: cataphora, anaphora and self-reference. </p>
<p><b>Bango</b> (Mobango, Babango), is a Bantu language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo. <i>Ethnologue</i> suggests it may be a dialect of Budza, but Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003) list it as one of the Bwa languages. </p>
<p>In linguistics, the <b>orthographic depth</b> of an alphabetic orthography indicates the degree to which a written language deviates from simple one-to-one letter–phoneme correspondence. It depends on how easy it is to predict the pronunciation of a word based on its spelling: shallow orthographies are easy to pronounce based on the written word, and deep orthographies are difficult to pronounce based on how they are written. </p><p>In shallow orthographies, the spelling-sound correspondence is direct: from the rules of pronunciation, one is able to pronounce the word correctly. In other words, shallow (transparent) orthographies, also called phonemic orthographies, have a one-to-one relationship between its graphemes and phonemes, and the spelling of words is very consistent. Such examples include Spanish, Italian, Finnish, and Turkish. </p><p>In contrast, in deep (opaque) orthographies, the relationship is less direct, and the reader must learn the arbitrary or unusual pronunciations of irregular words. In other words, deep orthographies are writing systems that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) that represent them. They may be irregular (English), reflect etymology (Hungarian, Faroese or French) or be morphophonemic (Korean). </p><p>Written Korean represents an interesting hybrid; each phoneme in the language is represented by a letter but the letters are packaged into "square" units of two to four phonemes, each square representing a syllable. Korean is not completely shallow but has some exceptions in which the written word is not pronounced exactly as the individual letter-phoneme correspondences would otherwise require. English has many such instances: compare the pronunciation of the letter "c" in the words "magic" and "magician" or the pronunciation of the letter "i" in "pint" and "mint". </p>

<p><b>Gorani</b> (also <b>Gurani</b>) is a group of Northwestern Iranian dialects spoken by groups of Iranian and Iraqi citizens in the southernmost parts of Iranian Kurdistan and the Iraqi Kurdistan region. It is classified as a member of the Zaza–Gorani branch of the Northwestern Iranian languages.</p><p>The Hewramî dialect, although often considered a sub-dialect of Gorani, is a very distinct dialect spoken by Gorani/Hewrami people in a region called Hewraman along the Iran–Iraq border, and is sometimes considered to be a distinct language.</p><p>Gorani is spoken in the southwestern corner of province of Kurdistan and northwestern corner of province of Kermanshah in Iran, and in parts of  the Halabja region in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Hawraman mountains between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan.</p><p>The oldest literary documents in these related languages, or dialects, are written in Gorani. </p><p>Many Gorani speakers belong to the religious grouping Yarsanism, with a large number of religious documents written in Gorani. </p><p>Gorani was once an important literary language in the parts of Western Iran but has since been replaced by Sorani. In the 19th century, Gorani as a language was slowly replaced by Sorani in several cities, both in Iran and Iraq. Today, Sorani is the primary language spoken in cities including Kirkuk, Meriwan, and Halabja, which are still considered part of the greater Goran region. </p><p>Kurds and Gorani speakers themselves tend to consider Gorani as a dialect of Kurdish group of languages, which diverged off from Kurmanji speakers, Badhini and Sorani alike, at around 100 BCE. The differences between the Zaza–Gorani languages and the Kurdish languages are too many, and are therefore far too great by any standard linguistic criteria to warrant classification as dialects of the same languages.</p>
<p><b>Signed French</b> (<i>Français Signé</i>) is any of at least three manually coded forms of French that apply the words (signs) of a national sign language to French word order or grammar.

Signed French is used in education and for simultaneous translation, not as a natural form of communication among deaf people. </p>
<p><b>Kohāṭī</b> is a Hindko dialect of Kohat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, north-western Pakistan. It is spoken in the city of Kohat as well as in a string of villages running east along the road to Kushalgarh on the Indus. The dominant language of this area is Pashto, to which Kohati has been losing ground at least since Partition. Kohati forms part of the "Hindko proper" group of dialects alongside Awankari, Chacchi and Ghebi.</p><p>It has borrowed words from Pashto to a higher extent than other Hindko dialects. A lexical similarity study based on a 210-item wordlist found out that it shares 79% of its vocabulary with the Hindko dialect spoken to the east in the city of Attock, and 76% each with the dialects further east in Talagang Tehsil and Haripur District, as well as the rural dialect spoken immediately north in Peshawar District.</p><p>There are two phonological characteristics which distinguish Kohati from other Hindko varieties. One is the regular loss of nasalisation in rounded vowels at the end of a word (<i>tũ</i> &gt; <i>tu</i> 'you'). The other one is the peculiar realisation of historical <i>-dʒ-</i> as <i>-i-</i>, almost <i>-yy-</i>, in the word <i>ʌi</i> 'today' and in forms of the verb 'to go', for example <i>vʌ̃ie</i> 'let him go' (in contrast respectively to <i>ʌdʒ</i> and <i>vʌɳdʒe</i> in the rest of Hindko).</p><p>Kohati also has a peculiar distribution of the dative-accusative postposition. As in other Indo-Aryan languages, the form of the noun used before postpositions is the oblique: <i>pʊttʊr</i> 'son' for example has the oblique form <i>pʊtre</i>. To this form Kohati appends the postposition <i>ã</i> to form the dative-accusative: <i>pʊtre ã</i> '(to) the son', which is the pattern found in the rest of Hindko (in contrast to Punjabi where the postpostion is <i>nũ</i> or Saraiki, where it is <i>kũ</i>). But because the oblique form in the plural is also <i>-ã</i>, Kohati avoids the succession of identical vowels by switching to <i>ko</i> in the plural: thus <i>pʊtrã ko</i> '(to) the sons'.</p>

<p>In grammar, the term <b>weak</b> (originally coined in German: <i>schwach</i>) is used in opposition to the term strong (<i>stark</i>) to designate a conjugation or declension when a language has two parallel systems.

<p><b>Kim Tu-bong</b> (February 16, 1889 – March 1958 or later) was the first Chairman of the Workers' Party of North Korea from 1946 to 1949. He was known in Korean history as a linguist, scholar and politician. His most famous work was under Ju Sigyeong; later, after participating in the March 1st Movement, he with other Korean leaders of the time established a provisional government-in-exile in China, and because of his communist beliefs he played an important role in the early North Korean communist government.  </p><p>He and other members of the Yan'an faction formed the New People's Party when they returned from exile. After the New People's Party merged into the Workers Party of North Korea (WPNK) in 1946 at the 1st WPNK Congress, he became WPNK Chairman. He was the first head of state (Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly) of North Korea from 1948 to 1957. He is most remembered in South Korea for his efforts in establishing the Korean linguistic field and especially that of Hangul. Much of his work both political and linguistically was done while living in China with the exiled government of Korea. He is also known by his pen name Baekyeon. He was purged by Kim Il-sung in 1957. </p>
<p>In phonology, <b>minimal pairs</b> are pairs of words or phrases in a particular language, spoken or signed, that differ in only one phonological element, such as a phoneme, toneme or chroneme, and have distinct meanings. They are used to demonstrate that two phones are two separate phonemes in the language. </p><p>Many phonologists in the middle part of the 20th century had a strong interest in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages. The major work of Kenneth Pike on the subject is <i>Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing</i>. The minimal pair was an essential tool in the discovery process and was found by <b>substitution</b> or <b>commutation</b> tests.</p><p>Modern phonology is much less interested in such issues, and the minimal pair is consequently considered to be of little theoretical importance.</p><p>As an example for English vowels, the pair "l<b>e</b>t" + "l<b>i</b>t" can be used to demonstrate that the phones <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɛ]</span> (in l<b>e</b>t) and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɪ]</span> (in l<b>i</b>t) actually represent distinct phonemes <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɛ/</span> and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɪ/</span>. An example for English consonants is the minimal pair of "<b>p</b>at" + "<b>b</b>at". The following table shows other pairs demonstrating the existence of various distinct phonemes in English. All of the possible minimal pairs for any language may be set out in the same way. </p> <p>Phonemic differentiation may vary between different dialects of a language so a particular minimal pair in one accent may be a pair of homophones in another. That means not that one of the phonemes is absent in the homonym accent but only that it is not contrastive in the same range of contexts. </p>

<p><b>Rlab</b> is an interactive, interpreted numerical computation program and its core programming language, written by Ian Searle. Rlab (the language) is very high level and is intended to provide fast prototyping and program development, as well as easy data-visualization, and processing. </p><p>Rlab was not designed as a clone of MATLAB. However, as Rlab (the program) is intended to provide a good experimental environment (or laboratory) in which to do matrix math, the programming language possesses similar operators and concepts and could be called <i>MATLAB-like</i>. </p><p>Rlab borrows some of the best features of the MATLAB language but provides them through a different syntax that has been modified in order to be more expressive while reducing ambiguity. The variable scoping rules facilitate the creation of larger programs and re-usable program libraries. A heterogeneous associative array datatype has been added to allow users to create and operate on arbitrary data structures. The fundamental data type is the dense floating point matrix (either real or complex), though string and sparse numerical matrices (both real and complex) are also provided. </p><p>Rlab 2.1 is no longer under active development. Binary versions are available for Linux and for Windows, and source code is available under the GPL. </p><p>Rlab 2.2 has been released as a part of the project <i><b>rlabplus</b></i> by Marijan Koštrun. </p>
<p><b>Dẹgẹma</b> is an Edoid language spoken in two separate communities on Degema Island in the Niger Delta, Nigeria, by about 22,000 people, according to 1991 census figures (including projection figures for the two Dẹgẹma-speaking communities). The two communities  are Usokun-Degema and Degema Town (Atala) in the Degema Local Government Area in Rivers State. Each community speaks a mutually intelligible variety of Dẹgẹma, known by the names of the communities speaking them: the Usokun variety (spoken in Usokun-Degema) and the Degema Town (Atala) variety (spoken in Degema Town). Both varieties are similar in their phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic properties. </p><p>No standard variety has so far emerged between the two varieties of Dẹgẹma. However, there appear to be more scholarly and descriptive linguistic publications on the Usokun variety than on the Degema Town (Atala) variety.</p><p>The Dẹgẹma language is not also called "Atala" or "Udekaama", as stated in some publications. Atala is the alternative name for one of the Degema-speaking communities (Degema Town), and Udekaama is the name of a clan (which comprises Usokun-Degema and Degema Town). Similarly, "Dekema" is not an alternative name for the Degema language as contained in the entry for Degema in the Ethnologue. </p>

<p><b>Real-Time Cmix</b> (RTcmix) is one of the MUSIC-N family of computer music programming languages.  RTcmix is descended from the MIX program developed by Paul Lansky at Princeton University in 1978 to perform algorithmic composition using digital audio soundfiles on a IBM 3031 mainframe computer.  After synthesis functions were added, the program was renamed Cmix in the 1980s.  Real-time capability was added by Brad Garton and David Topper in the mid-1990s, with support for TCP socket connectivity,  interactive control of the scheduler, and object-oriented embedding of the synthesis engine into fully featured applications. </p><p>Over the years Cmix/RTcmix has run on a variety of computer platforms and operating systems, including NeXT, Sun Microsystems, IRIX, Linux, and Mac OS X.  It is and has always been an open source project, differentiating it from commercial synthesizers and music software.  It is currently developed by a group of computer music researchers at Princeton, Columbia University, and the University of Virginia. </p><p>RTcmix has a number of unique (or highly unusual) features when compared with other synthesis and signal processing languages.  For one, it has a built-in MINC parser, which enables the user to write C-style code within the score file, extending its innate capability for algorithmic composition and making it closer in some respects to later music software such as SuperCollider and Max/MSP.  It uses a single-script instruction file (the score file), and synthesis and signal processing routines (called instruments) exist as compile  shared libraries.  This is different from MUSIC-N languages such as  Csound where the instruments exist in a second file written in a specification language that builds the routines out of simple building blocks (organized as opcodes or unit generators).  RTcmix has similar functionality to Csound and other computer music languages, however, and their shared lineage means that scripts written for one language will be extremely familiar-looking (if not immediately comprehensible) to users of the other language. </p>

<p>A <b>lexical chain</b> is a sequence of related words in  writing, spanning short (adjacent words or sentences) or long distances (entire text). A chain is independent of the grammatical structure of the text and in effect it is a list of words that captures a portion of the cohesive structure of the text. A lexical chain can provide a context for the  resolution of an ambiguous term and enable identification of the concept that the term represents. </p><p>Examples of lexical chains are the following: </p><p>Rome → capital → city → inhabitant </p><p>Wikipedia → resource → web </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p>  <p>The <b>Celtic nations</b> are territories in western Europe where Celtic languages or cultural traits have survived. The term "nation" is used in its original sense to mean a people who share a common identity and culture and are identified with a traditional territory. </p><p>The six territories widely considered Celtic nations are Brittany (<i>Breizh</i>), Cornwall (<i>Kernow</i>), Wales (<i>Cymru</i>), Scotland (<i>Alba</i>), Ireland (<i>Éire</i>) and the Isle of Man (<i>Mannin</i> or <i>Ellan Vannin</i>), commonly referred to as the "Celtic fringe". In each of the six nations a Celtic language is spoken: Brittonic or Brythonic languages are spoken in Brittany, Cornwall, and Wales, while Goidelic or Gaelic languages are spoken in Scotland, Ireland, and the Isle of Man.</p><p>Before the expansions of Ancient Rome and the Germanic and Slavic tribes, a significant part of Europe was dominated by Celts, leaving behind a legacy of Celtic cultural traits. Territories in north-western Iberia—particularly Galicia, northern Portugal and Asturias, historically referred to as Gallaecia and Astures, covering north-central Portugal and northern Spain—are considered Celtic nations due to their culture and history. Unlike the others, however, no Celtic language has been spoken there in modern times.</p><p>A genetics study from an Oxford University research team in 2006 claimed that the majority of Britons, including many of the English, are descended from a group of tribes which arrived from Iberia around 5000 BC, prior to the spread of Celts into western Europe. However, three major genetic studies in 2015 have instead shown that haplogroup R1b in western Europe, most common in traditionally Celtic-speaking areas of Atlantic Europe like Ireland and Brittany, would have largely expanded in massive migrations from the Indo-European homeland, the Yamna culture in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, during the Bronze Age along with carriers of Indo-European languages like proto-Celtic. Unlike previous studies, large sections of autosomal DNA were analyzed in addition to paternal Y-DNA markers. They detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic or Mesolithic Europeans, and which would have been introduced into Europe with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as the Indo-European languages. This genetic component, labelled as "Yamna" in the studies, then mixed to varying degrees with earlier Mesolithic hunter-gatherer and/or Neolithic farmer populations already existing in western Europe.</p>

<p>This article is an informal outline of the <b>grammar of Interlingua</b>, an international auxiliary language first publicized by IALA. It follows the usage of the original grammar text (Gode &amp; Blair, 1951), which is accepted today but regarded as conservative. </p><p>The grammar of Interlingua is based largely on that of the Romance languages, but simplified, primarily under the influence of English. However, all of the control languages, including German and Russian, were consulted in developing the grammar. Grammatical features absent from any of the primary control languages were dropped. For example, there is neither adjectival agreement  (Spanish/Portuguese <i>gatos negros</i> 'black cats'), since this feature is absent in English, nor continuous verb tenses (English <i>I am reading</i>), since they are absent in French and German.  Conversely, Interlingua has articles unlike Russian. </p><p>There is no systemic marking for parts of speech. For example, nouns do not have to end in any particular letter. Typically, however, adjectives end in <i>-e</i> or a consonant, adverbs end in <i>-mente</i> or <i>-o</i>, while nouns end in <i>-a, -e, -o</i> or a consonant. Finite verbs virtually always end in <i>-a, -e,</i> or <i>-i</i>, while infinitives add <i>-r</i>: <i>scribe</i>, 'write', 'writes'; <i>scriber</i>, 'to write'. </p>

<p><b>Gothic</b> is an extinct East Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. It is known primarily from the <i>Codex Argenteus</i>, a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation, and is the only East Germanic language with a sizable text corpus.  All others, including Burgundian and Vandalic, are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from loanwords in other languages such as Portuguese, Spanish, and French. </p><p>As a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the Indo-European language family. It is the earliest Germanic language that is attested in any sizable texts, but it lacks any modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the fourth century. The language was in decline by the mid-sixth century, partly because of the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the Franks, the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).  The language survived as a domestic language in the Iberian peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal) as late as the eighth century. Gothic-seeming terms are found in manuscripts subsequent to this date, but these may or may not belong to the same language. In particular, a language known as Crimean Gothic survived in the lower Danube area and in isolated mountain regions in Crimea. Lacking certain sound changes characteristic of Gothic, however, Crimean Gothic cannot be a lineal descendant of Bible Gothic.</p><p>The existence of such early attested texts makes it a language of considerable interest in comparative linguistics. </p>

<p><b>Nsibidi</b> (also known as <b>nsibiri</b>, <b>nchibiddi</b> or <b>nchibiddy</b>) is a system of symbols indigenous to what is now southeastern Nigeria that is apparently an ideographic script, though there have been suggestions that it includes logographic elements. The symbols are at least several centuries old—early forms appeared on excavated pottery as well as what are most likely ceramic stools and headrests from the Calabar region, with a range of dates from 400 to 1400 CE.</p><p>There are thousands of nsibidi symbols, of which over 500 have been recorded. They were once taught in a school to children. Many of the signs deal with love affairs; those that deal with warfare and the sacred are kept secret. Nsibidi is used on wall designs, calabashes, metals (such as bronze), leaves, swords, and tattoos. It is primarily used by the Ekpe leopard secret society (also known as Ngbe or Egbo), which is found across Cross River among the Ekoi, Efik, Igbo people, and other nearby peoples. </p><p>Outside knowledge of nsibidi came in 1904 when T. D. Maxwell noticed the symbols. Before the British colonisation of the area, nsibidi was divided into a sacred version and a public, more decorative version which could be used by women. Aspects of colonisation such as Western education and Christian doctrine drastically reduced the number of nsibidi-literate people, leaving the secret society members as some of the last literate in the symbols. Nsibidi was and is still a means of transmitting Ekpe symbolism. Nsibidi was transported to Cuba and Haiti via the Atlantic slave trade, where it developed into the <i>anaforuana</i> and <i>veve</i> symbols.</p>

<p>In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, <b>stemming</b> is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form—generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation. </p><p>A computer program or subroutine that stems word may be called a <i>stemming program</i>, <i>stemming algorithm</i>, or <i>stemmer</i>. </p>

<p><b>Linguistic purism in Icelandic</b> is the policy of  substituting loanwords with the creation of new words from Old Icelandic and Old Norse roots and preventing new loanwords from entering the language. In Iceland, linguistic purism is archaising, trying to resuscitate the language of a golden age of Icelandic literature. The effort began in the early 19th century, at the dawn of the Icelandic national movement, aiming at replacing older loanwords, especially from Danish, and it continues today, targeting English words.

<p>The <b>Hatran alphabet</b> is the script used to write Aramaic of Hatra, also known as Ashurian Aramaic, a dialect that was spoken from approximately 98-97 BC (year 409 of the Seleucid calendar) to 240 AD by early inhabitants of present-day northern Iraq. Many inscriptions of this alphabet could be found at Hatra, an ancient city in northern Iraq built by the Seleucid Empire and also used by the Parthian Empire, but subsequently destroyed by the Sassanid Empire in 241 AD. Assur also has several inscriptions which came to an end following its destruction by the Sasanian in 257 AD while the rest of the inscriptions are spread sparsely throughout Duro-Europos, Gaddala, Tur Abdin, Tikrit, Sa'adiya and Qabr Abu Naif. Many of the contemporary ruins were destroyed by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in early 2015. It was encoded in the Unicode Standard 8.0 with support from UC Berkeley's Script Encoding Initiative. </p>
<p>The <b>Formosan languages</b> are the languages of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, all of which are Austronesian. The Taiwanese aborigines recognized by the government are about 2.3% of the island's population. However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language because of centuries of language shift. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are extinct, another four (perhaps five) are moribund, and several others are to some degree endangered. </p><p>The aboriginal languages of Taiwan have significance in historical linguistics since in all likelihood, Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family. According to linguist Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the Austronesian language family, while the one remaining principal branch contains nearly 1,200 Malayo-Polynesian languages found outside Taiwan. Although some other linguists disagree with some details of Blust's analysis, a broad consensus has coalesced around the conclusion that the Austronesian languages originated in Taiwan. The theory has been strengthened by recent studies in human population genetics, supporting also the matrilineal nature of the migration.</p>

<p><b>WWF</b> is a modification of the open standard PDF format for document exchange endorsed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (also abbreviated WWF) Germany. The WWF format is promoted as being more environmentally friendly than other comparable document exchange formats (e.g. PDF or DOC) since documents in this format are designed to be more difficult to print. The motivation behind the use of the format is to prevent unnecessary printing of documents. The website claims that the file format will be able to be read by most programs that can open ordinary PDF files. At present, the software for creating WWF files is available for Mac OS X 10.4 and for Windows XP and later. An Open Source equivalent is available for Linux and for Windows XP and later.</p>

<p><b>Representational systems</b> (also known as <b>sensory modalities</b> and abbreviated to <b>VAKOG</b> or known as the <b>4-tuple</b>) is a postulated model from neuro-linguistic programming, a pseudoscientific collection of models and methods regarding how the human mind processes and stores information. The central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses, qualia.</p><p>According to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems. So for example the words "black", "clear", "spiral" and "image" reference the <i>visual</i> representation system; similarly the words "tinkling", "silent", "squeal" and "blast" reference the <i>auditory</i> representation system.  Bandler and Grinder also propose that ostensibly metaphorical or figurative language indicates a reference to a representational system such that it is actually <i>literal</i>.  For example, the comment "I see what you're saying" is taken to indicate a visual representation.</p><p>Further, Bandler and Grinder claim that each person has a "most highly valued" (now commonly termed <i>preferred</i>) representational system in which they are more able to vividly create an experience (in their mind) in terms of that representational system, tend to use that representational system more often than the others, and have more distinctions available in that representation system than the others.  So for example a person that most highly values their visual representation system is able to easily and vividly visualise things and has a tendency to do so in preference to creating or recreating an experience in terms of the other representational system. </p><p>Representational systems are one of the foundational ideas of NLP and form the basis of many NLP techniques and methods.</p>

It was brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers probably in the mid-5th century, and the first Old English literary works date from the mid-7th century. After the Norman conquest of 1066, English was replaced, for a time, as the language of the upper classes by Anglo-Norman, a relative of French. This is regarded as marking the end of the Old English era, as during this period the English language was heavily influenced by Anglo-Norman, developing into a phase known now as Middle English. </p><p>Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or Ingvaeonic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century. </p><p>Old English is one of the West Germanic languages, and its closest relatives are Old Frisian and Old Saxon. Like other old Germanic languages, it is very different from Modern English and difficult for Modern English speakers to understand without study. Old English grammar is quite similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have many inflectional endings and forms, and word order is much freer. The oldest Old English inscriptions were written using a runic system, but from about the 9th century this was replaced by a version of the Latin alphabet. </p>   
<p>Hebrew uses the Hebrew alphabet with optional vowel diacritics. The <b>romanization of Hebrew</b> is the use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words. </p><p>For example, the Hebrew name spelled <span dir="rtl">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span>‬ ("Israel") in the Hebrew alphabet can be romanized as <i><strong>Yisrael</strong></i> or <i><strong>Yiśrāʼēl</strong></i> in the Latin alphabet. </p><p>Romanization includes any use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. Transliteration uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas transcription uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.</p><p>To go the other way, that is from English to Hebrew, see Hebraization of English. Both Hebraization of English and Romanization of Hebrew are forms of transliteration. Where these are formalized these are known as "transliteration systems", and, where only some words, not all, are transliterated, this is known as "transliteration policy". </p>

<p><b>Algebraic Logic Functional programming language</b>, also known as <b>ALF</b>, is a programming language which combines functional and logic programming techniques. Its foundation is Horn clause logic with equality which consists of predicates and Horn clauses for logic programming, and functions and equations for functional programming. </p><p>ALF was designed to be genuine integration of both programming paradigms, and thus any functional expression can be used in a goal literal and arbitrary predicates can occur in conditions of equations. ALF's operational semantics is based on the resolution rule to solve literals and narrowing to evaluate functional expressions. In order to reduce the number of possible narrowing steps, a leftmost-innermost basic narrowing strategy is used which, it is claimed, can be efficiently implemented. Terms are simplified by rewriting before a narrowing step is applied and equations are rejected if the two sides have different constructors at the top. Rewriting and rejection are supposed to result in a large reduction of the search tree and produce an operational semantics that is more efficient than Prolog's resolution strategy. Similarly to Prolog, ALF uses a backtracking strategy corresponding to a depth-first search in the derivation tree. </p><p>The ALF system was designed to be an efficient implementation of the combination of resolution, narrowing, rewriting, and rejection. ALF programs are compiled into instructions of an abstract machine. The abstract machine is based on the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM) with several extensions to implement narrowing and rewriting. In the current ALF implementation programs of this abstract machine are executed by an emulator written in C. </p><p>In the Carnegie Mellon University Artificial Intelligence Repository, ALF is included as an AI programming language, in particular as a functional/logic programming language Prolog implementation. A user manual describing the language and the use of the system is available. The ALF System runs under Unix and is free. </p>

<p>There are a number of <b>languages of Morocco</b>. The two official languages are Modern Standard Arabic and Amazigh (Berber). Moroccan Arabic (known as Darija) is the spoken native vernacular. The languages of prestige in Morocco are Arabic in its Classical and Modern Standard Forms and French, the latter of which serves as a second language for many Moroccans. According to a 2000–2002 survey done by Moha Ennaji, author of <i>Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco</i>, "there is a general agreement that Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, and Berber are the national languages." Ennaji also concluded "This survey confirms the idea that multilingualism in Morocco is a vivid sociolinguistic phenomenon, which is favoured by many people."</p><p>There are around 12 million Berber speakers in Morocco, representing more than a fourth but less than a third of the population. French retains a major place in Morocco, as it is taught universally and serves as Morocco's primary language of commerce and economics, culture, sciences and medicine; it is also widely used in education and government. Morocco is a member of the Francophonie.</p>

Although detailed accounts of the language date to the end of the 19th century, linguistic research began only in the 1990s. </p><p>The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country. Erromintxela is a mixed language (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani but using Basque grammar, similar to the way the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society and the resultant bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay.</p>

<p><i><b>Étude sur l'argot français</b></i> ("Study of French slang") was the first publication in book form by the French linguist and author of short stories, Marcel Schwob. The book's co-author was Georges Guieysse. It was written in 1888 when the two had been attending the lectures of Ferdinand de Saussure and Michel Bréal at the Collège de France. On 12 May 1889, soon after they had corrected the proofs, Guieysse committed suicide at the age of 20. The book was published in that year by Émile Bouillon in Paris. </p><p>This short work is notable as the first full demonstration of the deliberate alterations of words that help to form the vocabulary of French slang or <i>argot</i>, and particularly of the special slang typical of the 19th century butchery trade, called <i>Loucherbem</i>. This name is a deliberate rearrangement of <i>boucher</i> ("butcher") and is itself an example of the processes discussed in the book. </p><p><i>Étude sur l'argot français</i> was the first of several contributions by Schwob to the study of the vocabulary of the 15th-century poet François Villon. </p>
<p><b>George P. Lakoff</b> (<span></span>; born May 24, 1941) is an American cognitive linguist and philosopher, best known for his thesis that  lives of individuals are significantly influenced by the central metaphors they use to explain complex phenomena. </p><p>The conceptual metaphor thesis, introduced in his and Mark Johnson's 1980 book <i>Metaphors We Live By</i> has found applications in a number of academic disciplines. Applying  it to politics, literature, philosophy and mathematics has led Lakoff into territory normally considered basic to political science. In his 1996 book <i>Moral Politics</i>, Lakoff described  conservative voters as being influenced by the "strict father model" as a central metaphor for such a complex phenomenon as the state, and liberal/progressive voters as being influenced by the "nurturant parent model" as the folk psychological metaphor for this complex phenomenon. According to him, an individual's experience and attitude towards sociopolitical issues is influenced by being framed in  linguistic constructions. In <i>Metaphor and War: The Metaphor System Used to Justify War in the Gulf</i> (1991), he argues that the American involvement in the Gulf war was obscured or "spun" by the metaphors which were used by the first Bush administration to justify it. Between 2003 and 2008, Lakoff was involved with a  progressive think tank, the now defunct Rockridge Institute. He is a member of the scientific committee of the  Fundación IDEAS (IDEAS Foundation), Spain's Socialist Party's think tank. </p><p>The more general theory that elaborated his thesis is known as embodied mind. Lakoff served as a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1972 until his retirement in 2016.</p>
<p><b>IMP</b> is an early systems programming language that was developed by Edgar T. Irons in the late 1960s through early 1970s. Unlike most other systems programming languages, IMP was an extensible syntax programming language. </p><p>Even though its designer refers to the language as "being based on ALGOL", IMP excludes many <i>defining</i> features of that language, while supporting a very non-ALGOL-like one: syntax extensibility. </p><p>A compiler for IMP existed as early as 1965 and was used for programming the CDC 6600 time-sharing system, which was in use at the Institute for Defense Analyses since 1967. Although the compiler is slower than comparable ones for non-extensible languages, it has been used for practical production work. </p><p>IMP compilers were developed for the CDC-6600, Cray, PDP-10 and PDP-11 computers. Important IMP versions were <b>IMP65</b>, <b>IMP70</b>, and <b>IMP72</b>. </p>

<p><span></span> <b>i*</b> (pronounced "i star") or <b>i*</b> framework is a modeling language suitable for an early phase of system modeling in order to understand the problem domain. i* modeling language allows to model both as-is and to-be situations. The name i* refers to the notion of distributed intentionality which underlines the framework. It is an approach originally developed for modelling and reasoning about organizational environments and their information systems composed of heterogeneous actors with different, often competing, goals that depend on each other to undertake their tasks and achieve these goals. It covers both actor-oriented and Goal modeling. i* models answer the question WHO and WHY, not what.  </p><p>In contrast, the UML Use case approach covers only functional goals, with actors directly involved in operations (typically with software). The KAOS approach covers goals of all types but is less concerned with the intentionality of actors.  </p>
<p><b>Just another Perl hacker</b>, or <b>JAPH</b>, typically refers to a Perl program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is canonical but is occasionally omitted).  Short JAPH programs are often used as signatures in online forums, or as T-shirt designs.  The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without code) for a signature. </p><p>JAPH programs are classically done using extremely obfuscated methods, in the spirit of the Obfuscated C Contest.  More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation). </p><p>The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature <i>as a signature</i> was originated by Randal L.

<p>The philologist and author J. R. R. Tolkien created a number of constructed languages, including languages devised for fictional settings. Inventing languages  (called <i>glossopoeia</i> by Tolkien, from Greek γλώσσα glôssa, "language, tongue" and ποιῶ poiô, "to make" paralleling his idea of <i>mythopoeia</i> or myth-making) was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens. An early project of Tolkien was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early Germanic language which might have been spoken by the people of <i>Beowulf</i> in the Germanic heroic age.</p><p>The most-developed project of Tolkien was his Elvish languages. He first started  constructing an <i>Elvin tongue</i> in  <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span> 1910–1911</span> while he was at the King Edward's School, Birmingham. He later called it Quenya (<abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span> 1915</span>), and he continued actively developing the history and grammar of his Elvish languages until his death in 1973. </p><p>In 1931, he held a lecture about his passion for constructed languages, titled <i>A Secret Vice</i>. Here he contrasts his project of artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure with the pragmatism of international auxiliary languages. The lecture also discusses Tolkien's views on phonaesthetics, citing Greek, Finnish, and Welsh as examples of "languages which have a very characteristic and in their different ways beautiful word-form". </p><p>Tolkien's glossopoeia has two temporal dimensions: the internal (fictional) timeline of events described in <i>The Silmarillion</i> and other writings, and the external timeline of Tolkien's own life during which he often revised and refined his languages and their fictional history. </p>
<p><b>Oorlams</b> (also: <i>Oorlands</i>, <i>Oorlans</i>) is a dialect of Afrikaans spoken in the Republic of South Africa and Namibia, by the Oorlam people.  </p><p>It is considered to be either an Afrikaans-based creole language or a dialect of Afrikaans proper.  </p><p>Oorlams has many elements from Khoi languages. </p>
<p>In pragmatics, the <b>origo</b> is the reference point on which deictic relationships are based. </p><p>In most deictic systems, the origo identifies with the current speaker (or some property thereof). For instance, if the speaker, John, were to say "This is now my fish", then John would be the origo, and the deictic word "my" would be dependent on that fact. Likewise, his use of the word "this" and "now" communicate his properties, namely his location and point in time.  </p><p>The word origo comes from Latin <i>origo</i>, which means "origin" (pl. <i>origines</i>). <i>Origo</i> is also the origin of the English word "origin". </p><p>This word also occurs in the term phrase <i>fons et origo</i>, meaning "source and origin" (<i>fons</i>, "source", <i>et</i>, "and", "even"). </p>
<p><b>Greek ligatures</b> are graphic combinations of the letters of the Greek alphabet that were used in medieval handwritten Greek and in early printing. Ligatures were used in the cursive writing style and very extensively in later minuscule writing. There were dozens of conventional ligatures. Some of them stood for frequent letter combinations, some for inflectional endings of words, and some were abbreviations of entire words. </p><p>In early printed Greek from around 1500, many ligatures fashioned after contemporary manuscript hands continued to be used. Important models for this early typesetting practice were the designs of Aldus Manutius in Venice, and those of Claude Garamond in Paris, who created the influential Grecs du roi typeface in 1541. However, the use of ligatures gradually declined during the 17th and 18th centuries and became mostly obsolete in modern typesetting. Among the ligatures that remained in use the longest are the ligature Ȣ for ου, which resembles an <i>o</i> with an <i>u</i> on top, and the abbreviation ϗ for <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">καὶ</span> ('and'), which resembles a κ with a downward stroke on the right. The ου ligature is still occasionally used in decorative writing, while the <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">καὶ</span> abbreviation has some limited usage in functions similar to the Latin ampersand (&amp;). Another ligature that was relatively frequent in early modern printing is a ligature of Ο with ς (a small sigma <i>inside</i> an omicron) for a terminal ος. </p><p>The ligature <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text">ϛ</span> for στ, now called stigma, survived in a special role besides its use as a ligature proper. It took on the function of a number sign for "6", having been visually conflated with the cursive form of the ancient letter digamma, which had this numeral function. </p>

<p>In formal grammar theory, the <b>deterministic context-free grammars</b> (<b>DCFGs</b>) are a proper subset of the context-free grammars. They are the subset of context-free grammars that can be derived from deterministic pushdown automata, and they generate the deterministic context-free languages. DCFGs are always unambiguous, and are an important subclass of unambiguous CFGs; there are non-deterministic unambiguous CFGs, however. </p><p>DCFGs are of great practical interest, as they can be parsed in linear time and in fact a parser can be automatically generated from the grammar by a parser generator. They are thus widely used throughout computer science. Various restricted forms of DCFGs can be parsed by simpler, less resource-intensive parsers, and thus are often used. These grammar classes are referred to by the type of parser that parses them, and important examples are LALR, SLR, and LL. </p>
<p><b>Aika</b> is an open source text mining engine. It can automatically extract and annotate semantic information into text. In case this information is ambiguous, Aika will generate several hypothetical interpretations concerning the meaning of the text and pick the most likely one. Aika is written in Java and distributed under the Apache license. </p><p>The Aika algorithm is based on various ideas and approaches from the field of AI such as artificial neural networks, frequent pattern mining and logic based expert systems. It can be applied to a broad spectrum of text analysis tasks and combines these concepts in a single algorithm.  Aika is based on non-monotonic logic, meaning that it first draws tentative conclusions only. In other words, Aika is able to generate multiple mutually exclusive interpretations of a word, phrase, or sentence, and select the most likely interpretation. It does so by propagating activations through a neural network. These activations can be seen as a kind of text annotation since they refer to a specific text segment and a given interpretation.  Aika consists of two layers. The neural layer, containing all the neurons and continuously weighted synapses and underneath that the discrete logic layer, containing a boolean representation of all the neurons. The logic layer uses a frequent pattern lattice to efficiently store the individual logic nodes. </p>
<p>Using <b>controlled language in machine translation</b> poses several problems. </p><p>In an automated translation, the first step in order to understand the controlled language is to know what it is and to distinguish between natural language and controlled language. </p><p>The main problem in machine translation is a linguistic problem. Language is ambiguous and the system tries to model a language on lexical and grammatical way.

<p>In computing, a <b>parallel programming model</b> is an abstraction of parallel computer architecture, with which it is convenient to express algorithms and their composition in programs. The value of a programming model can be judged on its <i>generality</i>: how well a range of different problems can be expressed for a variety of different architectures, and its <i>performance</i>: how efficiently the compiled programs can execute. The implementation of a parallel programming model can take the form of a library invoked from a sequential language, as an extension to an existing language, or as an entirely new language. </p><p>Consensus around a particular programming model is important because it leads to different parallel computers being built with support for the model, thereby facilitating portability of software. In this sense, programming models are referred to as <i>bridging</i> between hardware and software.</p>
<p>In grammar, <b>tense</b> is a category that expresses time reference with reference to the moment of speaking. Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs, particularly in their conjugation patterns.  </p><p>Basic tenses found in many languages include the past, present, and future. Some languages have only two distinct tenses, such as past and nonpast, or future and nonfuture. There are also tenseless languages, like most of the Chinese languages, though it can possess a future and nonfuture system, which is typical of Sino-Tibetan languages. On the other hand, some languages make finer tense distinctions, such as remote vs recent past, or near vs remote future. </p><p>Tenses generally express time relative to the moment of speaking. In some contexts, however, their meaning may be relativized to a point in the past or future which is established in the discourse (the moment being spoken about). This is called <i>relative</i> (as opposed to <i>absolute</i>) tense. Some languages have different verb forms or constructions which manifest relative tense, such as pluperfect ("past-in-the-past") and "future-in-the-past". </p><p>Expressions of tense are often closely connected with expressions of the category of aspect; sometimes what are traditionally called tenses (in languages such as Latin) may in modern analysis be regarded as combinations of tense with aspect. Verbs are also often conjugated for mood, and since in many cases the three categories are not manifested separately, some languages may be described in terms of a combined tense–aspect–mood (TAM) system. </p>

<p><b>Thraco-Illyrian</b> is a hypothesis that the Thraco-Dacian and Illyrian languages comprise a distinct branch of Indo-European. <b>Thraco-Illyrian</b> is also used as a term merely implying a Thracian-Illyrian interference,  mixture or sprachbund, or as a shorthand way of saying that it is not determined whether a subject is to be considered as pertaining to Thracian or Illyrian. Downgraded to a geo-linguistic concept, these languages are referred to as Paleo-Balkan. </p><p>The linguistical hypothesis was especially current in the early 20th century, but after the 1960s it was seriously called into question.

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The <b>Cyrillic script</b> <span></span> is a writing system used for various alphabets across Eurasia, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and North Asia. It is based on the Early Cyrillic alphabet developed during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire. It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, especially those of Orthodox Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. As of  2011, around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them. With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following Latin and Greek.</p><p>Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script, augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet, including some ligatures. These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek. The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine  brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on. Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius. </p><p>In the early 18th century, the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great, who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe. The new form of letters became closer to the Latin alphabet, several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great (such as Я which was inspired by Latin R). West European typography culture was also adopted.</p>

<p>This is a list of dictionaries considered authoritative or complete by approximate number of total words, or headwords, included.  These figures do not take account of entries with senses for different word classes (such as noun and adjective) and homographs. Although it is possible to count the number of entries in a dictionary, it is not possible to count the number of words in a language. In compiling a dictionary, a lexicographer decides whether the evidence of use is sufficient to justify an entry in the dictionary. This decision is not the same as determining whether the word exists.</p> 
<p>The <b>dagger alif</b> or <b>superscript alif</b> (Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ألف خنجرية</span>‎ <i lang="ar-Latn" title="American Library Association – Library of Congress transliteration"><i>alif khanjariyya</i></i>) is written as a short vertical stroke on top of an Arabic letter.

The dagger alif occurs in only a few modern words, but these include some common ones; it is seldom written, however, even in fully vocalised texts, excepting the Qur'an. As Wright notes "[alif] was at first more rarely marked than the other long vowels, and hence it happens that, at a later period, after the invention of the vowel-points, it was indicated in some very common words merely by a fètḥa [i.e. the dagger alif.]" Most keyboards do not have dagger alif.

<p>In linguistics, <b>semantic analysis</b> is the process of relating syntactic structures, from the levels of phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the level of the writing as a whole, to their language-independent meanings. It also involves removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural contexts, to the extent that such a project is possible.  The elements of idiom and figurative speech, being cultural, are often also converted into relatively invariant meanings in semantic analysis. Semantics, although related to pragmatics, is distinct in that the former deals with word or sentence choice in any given context, while pragmatics considers the unique or particular meaning derived from context or tone. To reiterate in different terms, semantics is about universally coded meaning, and pragmatics, the meaning encoded in words that is then interpreted by an audience.</p><p>Semantic analysis can begin with the relationship between individual words.  This requires an understanding of lexical hierarchy, including hyponymy and hypernymy, meronomy, polysemy, synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms. It also relates to concepts like connotation (semiotics) and collocation, which is the particular combination of words that can be or frequently are surrounding a single word.  This can include idioms, metaphor, and simile, like, "white as a ghost." </p><p>With the availability of enough material to analyze, semantic analysis can be used to catalog and trace the style of writing of specific authors.</p>

<p>The <b>Almoravid dynasty</b> (Berber languages: <span lang="ber">ⵉⵎⵔⴰⴱⴹⵏ</span>, <i>Imrabḍen</i>; Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">المرابطون</span>‎, <i>Al-Murābiṭūn</i>) was an imperial Berber Muslim dynasty centered in Morocco. It established an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Founded by Abdallah ibn Yasin, the Almoravid capital was Marrakesh, a city the ruling house founded in 1062. The dynasty originated among the Lamtuna and the Gudala, nomadic Berber tribes of the Sahara, traversing the territory between the Draa, the Niger, and the Senegal rivers.</p><p>The Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of Al-Andalus to the Iberian Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the Castilian and Aragonese armies at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell—at the height of their power—when they failed to stop the Masmuda-led rebellion initiated by Ibn Tumart. As a result, their last king Ishaq ibn Ali was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the Almohad Caliphate, who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and Al-Andalus. </p>

<p><b>Thaana</b>, <b>Taana</b> or <b>Tāna</b> ( <span><span lang="dv" dir="rtl" title="Dhivehi language text">ތާނަ</span>‎</span> in Tāna script) is the present writing system of the Maldivian language spoken in the Maldives. Thaana has characteristics of both an abugida (diacritic, vowel-killer strokes) and a true alphabet (all vowels are written), with consonants derived from indigenous and Arabic numerals, and vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the Arabic abjad. Its orthography is largely phonemic. </p><p>The Thaana script first appeared in a Maldivian document towards the beginning of the 18th century in a crude initial form known as Gabulhi Thaana which was written <i>scripta continua</i>. This early script slowly developed, its characters slanting 45 degrees, becoming more graceful and spaces were added between words. As time went by it gradually replaced the older Dhives Akuru alphabet. The oldest written sample of the Thaana script is found in the island of Kanditheemu in <i>Northern Miladhunmadulu Atoll</i>. It is inscribed on the door posts of the main <i>Hukuru Miskiy</i> (Friday mosque) of the island and dates  back to 1008 AH (AD 1599) and 1020 AH (AD 1611) when the roof of the building were built and the renewed during the reigns of Ibrahim Kalaafaan (Sultan Ibrahim III) and Hussain Faamuladeyri Kilege (Sultan Hussain II) respectively. </p><p>Thaana, like Arabic, is written right to left. It indicates vowels with diacritic marks derived from Arabic. Each letter must carry either a vowel or a <i>sukun</i> (which indicates "no vowel"). The only exception to this rule is <i>nūnu</i> which, when written without a diacritic, indicates prenasalization of a following stop. </p><p>The vowel or diacritical signs are called <i>fili</i> in Maldivian; there are five <i>fili</i> for short vowels (a, i, u, e, o), where the first two look identical to the Arabic vowel signs (<i>fatha</i> and <i>kasra</i>) and the third one (damma) looks somewhat similar. Long vowels (ā, ē, ī, ō and ū) are denoted by doubled <i>fili</i> (except ō, which is a modification of the short <i>obofili</i>). </p>   <p>The letter <i>alifu</i> has no sound value of its own and is used for three different purposes: It can act as a carrier for a vowel with no preceding consonant, that is, a word-initial vowel or the second part of a diphthong; when it carries a <i>sukun</i>, it indicates gemination (lengthening) of the following consonant; and if <i>alifu</i>+<i>sukun</i> occurs at the end of a word, it indicates that the word ends in /eh/. Gemination of nasals, however, is indicated by <i>nūnu</i>+sukun preceding the nasal to be geminated. </p>

<p>The distinction between <b>broad and general accents</b> is a socio-culturo-economic contrast commonly made between different accents of the same language, typically spoken in a single geographical location: </p> <ul><li>A <b>broad accent</b> (sometimes equated with a <b>local</b> or <b>vernacular accent</b>) is popularly perceived as very "strong" or "thick", highly recognizable to a particular population (typically within a particular region), and often linguistically conservative; almost always, it is the accent associated with the traditional speech of the local people or the working class (whether rural or urban) of a given region.</li> <li>A <b>general accent</b> is perceived as geographically more widespread, not particularized to a certain population or location, sounding more "neutral" or "weak", and historico-linguistically innovative; it is typically associated with the middle class of a given region, a growing process of standardization or supraregionalization that transcends local boundaries, or more "mainstream" speakers in general.</li></ul><p>Sometimes a third category is also distinguished: a <i>cultivated accent</i> that is considered particularly cultured, stylish, affluent, or even contrived, associated with the educated upper class of a given region. All three distinctions are well studied varieties within South African, New Zealand, and Australian English phonology. The capitalized term "broad" before a location is common in the United Kingdom, such as "Broad Lancashire" or "Broad Yorkshire". The alleged mainstream English accent of the United States has been called "General American" since the early-mid 20th century. </p><p><i>Broad</i> and <i>general</i> are not definitively established terms in phonology and phonetics, and thus other terms are commonly used to make the same basic distinction. Irish linguist Raymond Hickey, for example, has classified the broad, traditional accent of Dublin as "local" and the city's general accents collectively as "non-local." He has also referred to a particular general and non-local accent common throughout Ireland as "supraregional."</p>

<p><b>Leeward Caribbean Creole English</b>, also known by the names of the various islands on which it is spoken (Antiguan Creole, Saint Kitts Creole, etc.), is an English-based creole language spoken in the Leeward Islands of the Caribbean, namely the countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, and Nevis. </p><p>There are subtle differences in the language's usage by different speakers, and islanders often use it in combination with Standard English. The tendency to switch back and forth from Creole to Standard English often seems to correlate with the class status of the speaker. Persons of higher social status tend to switch between Standard English and Creole more readily, due to their more extensive formal education in the English-language school system. Creole usage is more common, and is less similar to Standard English, as speakers descend the socioeconomic ladder. </p><p>Many Creole words are derived from English or African origins. The creole was formed when slaves owned by English planters imitated the English of their enslavers but pronounced it with their own inflections. This can be easily seen in phrases such as "Me nah go," meaning "I am not going," or in "Ent it?," presumably a cognate of "Ain't it?" </p>

<p><b>Juraj Habdelić</b> (17 April or 27 November 1609 in Staro Čiče – 27 November 1678 in Zagreb) was a Croatian Jesuit priest, writer and lexicographer. </p><p>His parents were Boldižar Habdelić and Margarita Kraljić. He went to gymnasium in Zagreb, studied philosophy in Graz and theology in Trnava. He worked as a teacher in Rijeka, Varaždin and Zagreb where he became the rector of Jesuit Collegium and manager of Seminary. During his rectorship, the gymnasium was attended by Pavao Ritter Vitezović who will, in his own way, continue the Habdelić's linguistic work, but on different foundations than those taught by the Jesuit gymnasium.</p>  <p>Although Habdelić's prose does not really fit the modern definition of literature, his work is nevertheless powerful and fresh, especially in richness of the language he uses. His are the works of moral-didactic issues, the first of which was <i>Zrcalo Marijansko</i> (<i>Mirror of Saint Mary</i>) published in Graz in 1662.</p>  <p>Christian morals is the main theme of Habdelić's literary work, but because a man is prone in violating these strict Christian norms and easily gives himself to sin, this is Habdelić's main literary preoccupation. His book intended for public uses, <i>Prvi otca našeg Adama greh</i> (<i>First sin of our father Adam</i>), published by Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, had 1200 pages, and is a picture of man's fall and his tendency to sin. What is especially important is the ability of Habdelić to analyze through that main theme all parts of society: nobles, citizens, peasants, and he doesn't spare the clergy either.</p><p>Writing about the actual events in Croatia at that time (Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy or Croatian and Slovenian peasant revolt led by Matija Gubec) he reveals himself as an upholder of the existing order. He considers the peasant rebellion as "volatility of the common people" and their tendency to chaotic behaviour, and the conspiracy as "arrogance of grand nobility".</p><p>Habdelić wrote in Kajkavian dialect and showed himself as an expert in the speech of commoners. At the same time he was opponent of common, profane things in which he also included folk songs, instructing his readers to discard "shameful, ungodly and impure songs".</p><p>With his work <i>Dictionar ili reči slovenske</i> (<i>Dictionary or Slavic words</i>) from 1670, he takes prominent, although layman, place in history of Croatian literature and linguistics. Namely, being without any special linguistic knowledge and writing for school papers he wrote Croatian-Latin dictionary. His total work is a mirror of Christian devotion with numerous examples from Jesuit and other religious literature but also a panoramic picture of Croatia in his time.</p>
<p>The <b>master–slave dialectic</b> is the common name for a famous passage of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, though the original German phrase, <i>Herrschaft und Knechtschaft</i>, is more properly translated as <b>Lordship and Bondage</b>. It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's philosophical system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers. </p><p>The passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, self-conscious beings. The essence of the dialectic is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a "struggle to the death" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it. </p>   
<p><b>Complimentary language</b> is a speech act that caters to positive face needs.   Positive face, according to Brown and Levinson, is "the positive consistent self-image or 'personality' (crucially including the desire that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactions".  Many studies examine complimentary language in relation to gender because of the noticeable differences in compliment topic, explicitness, and response depending on gender of the speaker as well as the gender of the addressee. Analysts use these studies to demonstrate their theories about inherent differences between the genders and the societal impact of gender roles. </p>

<p><b>Reification</b> in natural language processing refers to where a natural language statement is transformed so actions and events in it become quantifiable variables. For example "John chased the duck furiously" can be transformed into something like </p> <dl><dd>(Exists e)(chasing(e) &amp; past_tense(e) &amp; actor(e,John) &amp; furiously(e) &amp; patient(e,duck)).</dd></dl><p>Another example would be "Sally said John is mean", which could be expressed as something like </p> <dl><dd>(Exists u,v)(saying(u) &amp; past_tense(u) &amp; actor(u,Sally) &amp; that(u,v) &amp; is(v) &amp; actor(v,John) &amp; mean(v)).</dd></dl><p>Such representations allow one to use the tools of classical first-order predicate calculus even for statements which, due to their use of tense, modality, adverbial constructions, propositional arguments (<i>e.g.</i> "Sally said that X"), etc., would have seemed intractable. This is an advantage because predicate calculus is better understood and simpler than the more complex alternatives (higher-order logics, modal logics, temporal logics, etc.), and there exist better automated tools (<i>e.g.</i> automated theorem provers and model checkers) for manipulating it. </p><p>Reified forms can be used for other purposes besides the application of first-order logic; one example is the automatic discovery of synonymous phrases.</p><p>The reified forms are sometimes called <b>quasi-logical forms</b>, and the existential variables are sometimes treated as Skolem constants.</p><p>Not all natural language constructs admit a uniform translation to first order logic.

<p><b>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</b> (Classical Syriac: <span lang="syc" dir="rtl">ܣܘܪܝܬ</span>‎, <i>sūrët</i>), or simply <b>Assyrian</b>, is a Neo-Aramaic language within the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, that is largely spoken by Assyrian people, who are also known as Syriac Christians. The various Assyrian Aramaic dialects, including Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, have been heavily influenced by Classical Syriac, the Middle Aramaic dialect of Edessa, after its adoption as an official liturgical language, and they are ultimately descended from Old Aramaic, the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, displacing the East Semitic Assyrian dialect of Akkadian in around 10th century BC.</p><p>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is spoken by an estimated 200,000 people who are native to Upper Mesopotamia, which is a large region stretching from the plain of Urmia in northwestern Iran, to the Nineveh plains, and the Irbil, Kirkuk and Duhok regions in northern Iraq, together with the Al Hasakah region of northeastern Syria, and parts of southeastern Turkey. Instability throughout the Middle East over the past century has led to a worldwide diaspora of Assyrian speakers, with many speakers now living abroad, such as in North America, Australia and Europe. Speakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and Turoyo are ethnic Assyrians and are descendants of the ancient Assyrian inhabitants of Northern Mesopotamia.</p><p>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is one of the largest Neo-Aramaic languages (232,000 speakers), with Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (213,000 speakers) and Turoyo (250,000 speakers) making up most of the remaining Neo-Aramaic speakers. Despite the terms <i>Chaldean Neo-Aramaic</i> and <i>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic</i> indicating a separate ethnic identity, both the languages and their native speakers originate from the same Upper Mesopotamian region (which was Assyria).</p><p>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is, to a significant degree, mutually intelligible with Chaldean Neo-Aramaic and they are sometimes considered to constitute dialects of the same language rather than two separate languages. To a moderate degree, Assyrian is also intelligible with Senaya, Lishana Deni and Bohtan Neo-Aramaic (which are, at times, also considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic), and is partially intelligible with Lishan Didan, Hulaulá and Lishanid Noshan. Its mutual intelligibility with Turoyo, a Central Neo-Aramaic language, is rather limited.</p><p>Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is a moderately inflected, fusional language with a two-gender noun system and a rather flexible word order. There is some Akkadian vocabulary and influence in the language. Due to its location and cultural influences, the speakers may use Iranian, English and Arabic loanwords, depending on where they live or where their family came from. Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is written from right to left, and it uses the <i>Madnhāyā</i> version of the Syriac alphabet. Assyrian, alongside other modern Aramaic languages, is now considered endangered.</p>

<p>The <b>Abkhaz alphabet</b> is a Cyrillic alphabet of 62 letters used for the Abkhaz language. </p><p>Abkhaz did not become a written language until the 19th century. Up until then, Abkhazians, especially princes, had been using Greek (up to c. 9th century), Georgian (9–19th centuries), and partially Turkish (18th century) languages. The Abkhaz word for alphabet is <b>анбан</b> (anban), which was borrowed from Georgian <b>ანბანი</b> (anbani). </p><p>The first Abkhaz alphabet was created in 1862 by Dimitry Gulia and K. Machavariani. The script was developed by Peter von Uslar. It had 37 letters and was based on the Cyrillic script. In 1909, it was expanded to 55 letters by Aleksey Chochua to adjust to the extensive consonantal inventory of Abkhaz. </p><p>In 1926, during the <i>korenizatsiya</i> policy in the Soviet Union, the Cyrillic alphabet was replaced by a Latin alphabet devised by Nikolay Marr. It featured 76 letters and was called the "Abkhaz analytical alphabet". In 1928, this was replaced by another Latin alphabet. (See illustration at right.) From 1938 to 1954 the Abkhaz language was written in 3 Georgian alphabets: the Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. </p><p>Since 1954, the Abkhaz language has been written in a new 62-letter Cyrillic alphabet (see chart below). Of these, 38 are graphically distinct; the rest are digraphs with ⟨ь⟩ and ⟨ә⟩ which indicate palatalization and labialization, respectively. In 1996, the most recent reform of the alphabet was implemented: while labialization had hitherto been marked with two additional letters, ә and у, since then only ә was retained in this function. Unusually, the Cyrillic plosive letters К П Т represent ejective consonants; the non-ejectives (pulmonic consonants) are derived from these by means of a descender at the bottom of the letter. In the case of the affricates, however, the plain letter are pulmonic, and the derived letters ejective. </p><p>The modern Abkhaz orthography gives preference to the letters Г П with descender (Ӷ Ԥ) instead of hook (Ҕ Ҧ). The characters Ԥ and ԥ are encoded in Unicode since version 5.2.</p>

<p><b>BEFLIX</b> is the name of the first embedded domain-specific language for computer animation, invented by Ken Knowlton at Bell Labs in 1963. The name derives from a combination of <i>Bell Flicks</i>. Ken Knowlton used BEFLIX to create animated films for educational and engineering purposes. He also collaborated with the artist Stan Vanderbeek at Bell Labs to create a series of computer-animated films called <i>Poemfields</i> between 1966 and 1969. </p><p>BEFLIX was developed on the IBM 7090 mainframe computer using a Stromberg-Carlson SC2040 microfilm recorder for output. The programming environment targeted by BEFLIX consisted of a FORTRAN II implementation with FORTRAN II Assembly Program (FAP) macros.  The first version of BEFLIX was implemented through the FAP macro facility.  A later version targeting FORTRAN IV resembled a more traditional subroutine library and lost some of the unique flavor to the language. </p><p>Pixels are produced by writing characters to the screen of the microfilm recorder with a defocused electron beam. The SC2040 used a charactron tube to expose microfilm.  In BEFLIX, the electron beam is defocused to draw pixels as blurred character shapes.  Characters are selected to create a range of grayscale values for pixels. The microfilm recorder is not connected directly to the 7090, but communicates through magnetic tape.  BEFLIX writes the magnetic tape output on the 7090 and the film recorder reads the tape to create the film output.  BEFLIX also supports a preview mode where selected frames of the output are written to the line printer. </p>

<p>The <b>Vasconic languages</b> (from Latin <i>vasco</i> "Basque") are a putative family of languages that includes Basque and the extinct Aquitanian language. The extinct Iberian languages are also frequently included. </p><p>The concept of the Vasconic languages is often linked to the Vasconic substratum hypothesis of Theo Vennemann, who speculated that the ancestors of the Basque spread across Europe at the end of the last glacial period when the Cro-Magnons entered Europe and left traces in the modern languages of Europe. Along with other hypotheses that seek to relate Basque to other languages of the world, this is widely rejected by historical linguists.</p><p>Proponents of a Vasconic language family argue that Basque and the extinct Aquitanian language are close relatives, or that the modern varieties of Basque are distinct languages rather than dialects. However, these notions contradict conventional views on these languages, in two areas: </p> <ol><li>Theories regarding the relationship between Aquitanian and Basque, which suggest that either: <ul><li>Aquitanian is the ancestor of Basque, and as Larry Trask puts it: "Aquitanian is so closely related to Basque that we can, for practical purposes, regard it as being the more-or-less direct ancestor of Basque",</li> <li>or that a hypothetical Proto-Basque is the parent language of Aquitanian,</li></ul></li> <li>The view that varieties of Basque are dialects with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. This view is held by scholars such as Trask, Koldo Zuazo, and Koldo Mitxelena. Trask states: "Nonetheless, the diversification should not be exaggerated, as has often been done in the literature: the dialects are overwhelmingly congruent in their fundamentals and differ chiefly in vocabulary and in a few low-level phonological rules."</li></ol><p>Various attempts have been made to tie other languages, modern or extinct, such as Iberian, the language of the Nuraghe, and the language of the Cantabri and various others to Vasconic. None of these theories have been able to provide convincing data, and they are rejected by most mainstream Basque linguists.</p><p>A reconstruction of a Proto-Vasconic language is almost impossible with currently available information. More data and research are needed to reconstruct the basics of a proto-language, as well as more information surrounding the neighboring extinct languages such as Iberian and the relationship it has with Vasconic. Reconstruction of a hypothesized Vasconic Proto-language could only be done using the comparative method, although the accuracy of the reconstructed proto-language would still be uncertain. </p>

He volunteered for missionary service and in 1879 was sent to New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. Under the supervision of Bishop Paul Durieu, Le Jeune studied Chinook Jargon, a pidgin of Chinookan, Nootkan, French, and English. He moved on to Fraser Canyon, where he learned more native languages, and then to St. Mary's mission in the Lower Fraser Valley.</p><p>Over the next years Le Jeune traveled throughout the Kamloops region proselytizing to the native communities. In 1891 he became rector of St. Joseph's Church on the Kamloops Reserve and in 1893 he became the superior of St. Louis's Mission, a post he held until 1929.</p><p>By his own account, Le Jeune spoke more than twenty native languages. In 1890 he adapted Duployan shorthand to Chinook Jargon. The system was widely adopted among the native community and in 1891 Le Jeune launched a newspaper written in English and Chinook Jargon called the <i>Kamloops Wawa</i>. Le Jeune wrote a number of pamphlets about native languages such as <i>Practical Chinook vocabulary</i> (1886), <i>Prayers in the Okanagan language</i> (1893), <i>Polyglott manual of prayers</i> (1896, contributor), and <i>Chinook rudiments</i> (1924).</p><p>Le Jeune died in 1930 at New Westminster and is buried at Mission.

Comparisons of Phu Thai with other Tai languages such Tay Khang. have not yet been done systematically enough to yield convincing results.<br> Another aspect of Phu Thai is its contact with Katuic languages, a branch of the Austroasiatic languages. Whether in the Phu Thai areas of Central Laos or in more recent locations of Northeastern Thailand, one can find, along with Phu Thai, a few Katuic dialects known locally as Bru, So or Katang. James R.

<p>In Deaf culture and sign language, a <b>sign name</b> (or a <b>name sign</b>) is a special sign that is used to uniquely identify a person, just like a name. In the American Deaf community, there are some special cultural rules around sign names; for example, they must be agreed upon by the named person and the broader Deaf community. This ensures that no one else in the community already has the same sign name or that the same sign has a different meaning. Until a person receives a sign name, the person's name is usually fingerspelled.</p>

<p><b>Lola</b> is designed to be a simple hardware description language for describing synchronous, digital circuits. Niklaus Wirth developed the language to teach digital design on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to computer science students while a professor at ETH Zürich. </p><p>The purpose of Lola is to statically describe the structure and functionality of hardware components and of the connections between them. A Lola text is composed of declarations and statements. It describes the hardware on the gate level in the form of signal assignments. Signals are combined using operators and assigned to other signals. Signals and the respective assignments can be grouped together into types. An instance of a type is a hardware component. Types can be composed of instances of other types, thereby supporting a hierarchical design style and they can be generic (e.g. parametrizable with the word-width of a circuit). </p><p>All of the concepts mentioned above are demonstrated in the following example of a circuit for adding binary data. First, a fundamental building block (<tt>TYPE Cell</tt>) is defined, then  this <tt>Cell</tt> is used to declare a cascade of word-width 8, and finally the <tt>Cell</tt>s are connected to each other. The <tt>MODULE Adder</tt> defined in this example can serve as a building block on a higher level of the design hierarchy. </p> <pre>MODULE Adder;  TYPE Cell; (* Composite Type *)   IN x,y,ci:BIT; (* input signals *)   OUT z,co:BIT; (* output signals *)  BEGIN   z:=x-y-ci;   co:=x*y+x*ci+y*ci; END Cell;  CONST N:=8; IN X,Y:[N]BIT; ci:BIT; (* input signals *) OUT Z:[N]BIT; co:BIT; (* output signals *) VAR S:[N]Cell; (* composite type instances *) BEGIN   S.0(X.0, Y.0, ci); (* inputs in cell 0 *)   FOR i:=1..N-1 DO     S.i(X.i,Y.i,S[i-1].co); (* inputs in cell i *)   END;   FOR i:=0..N-1 DO     Z.i:=S.i.z; END;   co:=S.7.co; END Adder. </pre> <p>Wirth describes Lola from a user's perspective in his book <i>Digital Circuit Design</i>.

Gacería incorporated Galician, French, Basque and Arabic words into its vocabulary, a linguistic practice employed by other traveling professional groups of Castile.  Users of Gacería also incorporated words from Caló (Spanish Romani), Germanic languages and Catalan-Valencian. </p><p>These trade routes did not usually extend into the Basque Country or Valencia, but words from these foreign lexicons were incorporated for their foreignness. </p>  <p>Its vocabulary arose amongst those involved in the industry of manufacturing farm implements in the village (yokes, wagons, footstools; and the <i>threshing-board</i>, a wooden tool resembling a sledge, with his bottom-side holding many lithic flakes that cuts the pile of cereal crop, in order to separate the grain of the rest of the plant: threshing).  The argot was thus used by the itinerant salesmen of these products, in opposition to settled villagers.  In the face of mechanized agriculture, Gacería has survived amongst those who still sell such ancient farm implements as collectors' items.  </p>

The existence of such a language is widely accepted by specialists in linguistics, who have reconstructed a broad outline of the language by comparing the existing Kartvelian languages against each other. Several linguists, namely, Gerhard Deeters and Georgy Klimov have also reconstructed a lower-level proto-language called Proto-Karto-Zan or Proto-Georgian-Zan, which is the ancestor of Karto-Zan languages (includes Georgian and Zan).</p>

<p>The <b>Web Ontology Language</b> (<b>OWL</b>) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects. Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (typically monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand  are meant to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.</p><p>The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) XML standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest. </p><p>In October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Protégé and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++ and HermiT.</p><p>The OWL family contains many species, serializations, syntaxes and specifications with similar names. OWL and OWL2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications, respectively. Full species names will be used, including specification version (for example, OWL2 EL). When referring more generally, <i>OWL Family</i> will be used.</p>

<p>A <b>symbolic linguistic representation</b> is a representation of an utterance that uses symbols to represent linguistic information about the utterance, such as information about phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, or semantics. Symbolic linguistic representations are different from non-symbolic representations, such as recordings, because they use symbols to represent linguistic information rather than measurements. </p><p>A typical kind of symbolic linguistic representation is phonetic transcription. Symbolic linguistic representations are frequently used in computational linguistics. </p><p><br></p>

<p>There are over 521 languages spoken in Nigeria. The official and most commonly spoken language of Nigeria is English, the former language of colonial British Nigeria. In 2003, it was spoken by 60 million of the roughly 180 million people in Nigeria. Communication in the English language is much more popular in the country's urban communities than it is in the rural areas, due to colonisation. </p><p>The other major languages are Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, Urhobo, Ibibio, Edo, Fulfulde, Kanuri, and Igala. Nigeria's linguistic diversity is a microcosm of much of Africa as a whole, and the country contains languages from the three major African languages families: Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan and Niger–Congo. Nigeria also has several as-yet unclassified languages, such as Centúúm, which may represent a relic of an even greater diversity prior to the spread of the current language families. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Old Kentish Sign Language</b> (OKSL, also Old Kent Sign Language) is an extinct village sign language of 17th-century Kent in the United Kingdom, that has since been superseded by British Sign Language. </p><p>According to Peter Webster Jackson (2001), OKSL may have been the language used by a deaf boy described by 17th century British writer Samuel Pepys in his Diaries. Pepys was dining with his friend Sir George Downing on 9 November 1666, when the deaf servant had a conversation in sign language with his master, which included news of the Great Fire of London. Downing had been to school near Maidstone in Kent, where he lived in a community where congenital deafness was widespread. This population supported a sign language which was known by many hearing people as well as deaf.</p><p>As settlers of the Martha's Vineyard communities of Tisbury and Chilmark in Massachusetts migrated from the Kentish Weald, Nora Groce (1985) speculates that OKSL may be the origin of Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, which is, in turn, one of the precursors of American Sign Language (ASL). Others have cautioned against uncritical reception of this claim, "because no deaf people were part of the original migration from Kent, and nothing is known about any specific variety of signing used in Kent."</p>

<p> <b>Standard Macedonian</b> or <b>Literary Macedonian</b> (Macedonian: <span lang="mk">Книжевен македонски јазик</span> or Македонски литературен јазик) is the standard variety of the Macedonian language and official language of the Republic of Macedonia used as a written language, in formal contexts, and for communication between different dialect areas. Several prestige dialects have developed around the major urban centers of Skopje, Bitola, Veles and Prilep. </p><p>It was only in the 1940s, however, that the Macedonian language was able to be implemented, after being formally declared the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The rapid pace at which the standardization process took place was in part owing to an already existing interdialect (see Spoken Macedonian). The standard language is phonologically and morphologically based on the central Western Macedonian dialects (in particular, the Prilep-Bitola and Skopje-Veles dialect) with its lexicon influenced by all Macedonian dialects. </p><p>Educated speakers will usually use, or aim to use, the formal standard in public settings and in most forms of written language. Probably the best exemplars of this type of speech, though not always the case, are actors, teachers and writers. A high degree of social prestige and respect is assigned to those who correctly use the standard language in the appropriate situations. In extremely rare examples, some speakers will use the formal code exclusively in everyday conversational speech. </p><p>While acquisition of the formal code constitutes a significant part of elementary education, during which children are taught the relationship between their local dialect and the target code, the formal literary language. Most educated speakers switch to the colloquial register of the standard language, Spoken Macedonian, when communicating in less formal circumstances, but tend to aim for more formal usage in circumstances where educated speakers are present or as a sort of "interdialect" in the case where the company is not exclusively local. </p>

<p>In sign language, <b>mouthing</b> is the production of visual syllables with the mouth while signing. That is, signers sometimes say or mouth a word in a spoken language at the same time as producing the sign for it. Mouthing is one of the many ways in which the face and mouth is used while signing. Although not present in all sign languages, and not in all signers, where it does occur it may be an essential (that is, phonemic) element of a sign, distinguishing signs which would otherwise be homophones; in other cases a sign may seen to be flat and incomplete without mouthing even if it is unambiguous. Other signs use a combination of mouth movements and hand movements to indicate the sign; for example, the ASL sign for <span><span>NOT-YET</span></span> includes a mouth gesture where the mouth is slightly open. In such cases, mouthing is not available. </p><p>Mouthing often originates from oralist education, where sign and speech are used together. Thus mouthing may preserve an often abbreviated rendition of the spoken translation of a sign. In educated Ugandan Sign Language, for example, where both English and Ganda are influential, the word for <span><span>VERY</span></span>, Av", is accompanied by the mouthed syllable <i>nyo</i>, from Ganda <i>nnyo</i> 'very', and <span><span>ABUSE</span></span>, jO*[5]v", is accompanied by <i>vu</i>, from Ganda <i>onvuma</i>. Similarly, the USL sign <span><span>FINISH</span></span>, t55bf, is mouthed <i>fsh</i>, an abbreviation of English <i>finish</i>, and <span><span>DEAF</span></span>, }HxU, is mouthed <i>df</i>.  </p><p>However, mouthing may also be iconic, as in the word for <span><span>HOT</span></span> (of food or drink) in ASL, UtCbf", where the mouthing suggests something hot in the mouth and does not correspond to the English word "hot". </p><p>Mouthing is an essential element of cued speech and simultaneous sign and speech, both for the direct instruction of oral language and to disambiguate cases where there is not a one-to-one correspondence between sign and speech. However, mouthing does not always reflect the corresponding spoken word; when signing 'thick' in Auslan (Australian Sign Language), for example, the mouthing is equivalent to spoken <i>fahth</i>. </p><p>In a 2008 edition of <i>Sign Language &amp; Linguistics</i>, there is a study that discusses similarities and differences in mouthing between three different European sign languages.  It goes into detail about mouthings, adverbial mouth gestures, semantically empty mouth gestures, enacting mouth gestures, and whole face gestures.</p>

It focuses on topics related to the Albanian language, its purification, spread, and development, and possible changes on its standard form.</p><p>The magazine started in 1982. The necessity for a such magazine came due to difficulties that the linguistic situation in Kosovo, Republic of Macedonia, and other Albanian inhabited areas inside Yugoslavia. The Albanological Institute in Prishtina called a symposium to deal with the Albanian language issues raised so far, in December 1980. One of the outcomes of the symposium was the decision to create a magazine which would constantly visit the topics discussed. The magazine was named <i>Gjuha Shqipe</i> (The Albanian Language), similarly to the one which was recently coming out in Tirana, named <i>Gjuha Jonë</i> (Our Language), published back than by the Institute of Linguistics ad Literature (Albanian: <i lang="sq">Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe Letërsisë</i>).</p><p>Since then, it has given a major contribute in the enhancement of the Albanian language. The editorial staff has always solicited collaborators outside of former Yugoslavian republics, in Albania, in Arbereshe communities, and elsewhere, being a major characteristic of the magazine.

This because of the same standard and literary issues that the Albanian language faced and still does in general, and the editorial's goal of keeping the newspaper open to all and not local.</p><p>The frequency of the newspaper has varied in time due to political situation that the Albanological Institute encountered from 1982 till today. 3 volumes were published in 2015.</p>

<p><b>Joakim Stulić</b>, also <b>Joakim Stulli</b> as styled by himself, (1730–1817) was a lexicographer from the Republic of Ragusa, the author of the biggest dictionary in the older Croatian lexicography. </p><p>He was born in Dubrovnik, where he received his primary education and continued his studies in the Jesuit college and at the Franciscan monastery, where he studied philosophy and theology. Then he moved to Rome, where he studied theology at the central Franciscan site of learning in the Aracoeli monastery for three years. Stulić returned to Dubrovnik and started his lexicographic work around 1760, which would last for half a century, until 1810. </p><p>Stulli's lifetime achievement was his Latin–Italian–"Illyrian" dictionary. </p><p>In the beginning, Stulić's sources were the dictionary of Ardelio Della Bella, the lexicographic efforts of the <i>Akademija ispraznijeh</i> (Academy of the Idle) from Dubrovnik, and the Turin Dictionary, the best Italian academic dictionary of the 18th century. He also collected material from literary works and oral sources. </p><p>Stulli started looking for new material and a suitable printing press in the early 1770s,  when he visited Rome, Venice and Vienna in 1772 and 1773. His search for a sponsor and printer then took him to Bohemia, Saxony and Prussia. When his work was finished, he first contacted the Bohemian court administration in 1783. They initiated the procedure of verifying whether the work was good enough for printing. Since Stulić used the writing style of Dubrovnik/Dalmatia, a special imperial commission gathered in Vienna in 1785, including Antun Mandić, Joso Krmpotić, Marijan Lanosović and Stulić. The commission decided that the Slavonian scripting style would be used. </p><p>When all the linguistic, stylistic, monetary and printing obstacles were removed, the publication started. It was only in 1801 in Buda that the first part of the dictionary (<i>Lexicon latino–italico–illyricum</i>) was published. The second part came out four years later (1805) in Dubrovnik (<i>Rjecsosloxje u komu donosuse upotrebljenia, uredna, mucsnia istieh jezika krasnoslovja nacsini, izgovaranja i prorjecsja</i>). The third part was also published in Dubrovnik, in 1810 (<i>Vocabolario italiano-illirico-latino</i>). </p><p>Each part of the dictionary has two volumes. Its preparation used almost all the older Croatian dictionaries and the works of around one hundred writers. Stulić's dictionary is the largest work of older Croatian lexicography (more than 4,700 pages and around 80,000 words). </p><p>Since he considered the "Illyrian language" to be a universal Slavic language, he borrowed many words from other Slavic languages (Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Czech, Polish, Slovenian). But Stulli's dictionary is most valuable as a treasure of Croatian lexical material. </p>

<p><b>Ontology Grounded Metalanguage</b> (<b>OGML</b>) is a metalanguage like MOF. The goal of OGML is to tackle the difficulties of MOF: linear modeling architecture, ambiguous constructs and incomprehensible/unclear architecture. </p><p>OGML provides a nested modeling architecture with three fixed layers (models, languages and metalanguage). Therefore, it is clear how the different models conform to each other and can be handled. Constructs in OGML are chosen from the science of ontology, making the distinction between properties / objects and classes / objects very clear. This commitment makes explicit certain oddities of the definition of, for example, relations. </p><p>Furthermore, OGML provides an explicit notion of instantiation: model elements encode their types and languages define the semantics of instantiation. This extra information is needed in the relative modeling architecture to distinguish between structural and conceptual views on models, for example: we may want to view a UML model as an instance of the object language and an instance of the Class model (Clabject). By providing this dual view on the metamodel layer and on the language layer, OGML provides a very precise modeling architecture and an expressive way to deal with models. </p>

<p><b>Javanais</b> (<small>French pronunciation: ​</small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʒavanɛ]</span>) is a type of French slang where the extra syllable ⟨av⟩ is infixed inside a word after every consonant that is followed by a vowel, in order to render it incomprehensible.

The lyrics are a didactical method to learn the javanais. Each verse is firstly articulated in regular French, then translated in slang. As the title suggests, the song is a Java, a Parisian dance craze. In 1962, Serge Gainsbourg wrote and sang a song called <i>La Javanaise</i>, a pun playing on Javanese dancing and the javanais style of speaking. The song heavily employs unaltered French words that naturally have an ⟨av⟩ sequence; thus the lyrics resemble the word game of javanais. </p>

<p><b>Aka</b>, also known as <b>Yaka</b> or <b>Beka</b>, is a Bantu language spoken in the Central African Republic and Republic of Congo, along the Ubangi River dividing the two countries. </p><p>Aka is spoken by the Aka people, pygmies closely related to the Ubangian-speaking Baka of Cameroon, Congo and Gabon. Together, these peoples are known as the Mbenga (<i>Bambenga</i>) or Binga (<i>Babinga</i>), the latter derogatory. </p><p>Famously, Aka shares vocabulary with the Baka languages, mostly concerning a specialised forest economy, such as words for edible plants, medicinal plants and honey collecting. This is among the 30% of Aka which is not Bantu and the 30% of Baka which is not Ubangian and has been posited as the remnant of an ancestral Western Pygmy (Mbenga or "Baaka") language which has otherwise vanished. However, it is entirely possible that the Aka shifted to Bantu from a Ubangian language related to Baka, in which case the situation reduces to a single ethnic group adapted to the forest with correspondingly specialised vocabulary. There is no evidence for a wider linguistic affiliation with any of the other Pygmy peoples.</p><p>The Aka people call themselves <i>Mraka</i> in the singular and <i>Beka</i> in the plural. The people and their language go by various alternate spellings: <i>Mò-Áka, Moyaka, Bayaka, Yaga, Bayaga, Gbayaka, Biaka, Beká, Yakwa, Yakpa, Yakpwa, Nyoyaka.</i> The western Aka are known as the Benzele (<i>Mbenzélé, Babenzélé, Bambenzele, Ba-Benjelle</i>), and the eastern Aka as the Sese (<i>Basese</i>).

<p><b>Zipser German</b> (German: <b>Zipserisch</b>, <b>Zipserdeutsch</b>, Hungarian: <i>szepességi szász nyelv</i> or <i>cipszer nyelv</i>) is a Germanic dialect which developed in the Upper Zips region of what is now Slovakia among people who settled there from central Germany beginning in the 13th century. The Lower Zips was inhabited by other Central Germans who spoke a similar dialect called "Gründlerisch" which is considered to be the same language. Beginning in at least the 18th century, many Zipsers migrated to northern Romania, including to southern Bukovina, where several other Germanic dialects were also spoken. Over time, the speech of the Zipsers in Romania was heavily influenced by that of people from Upper Austria who settled among them and were ultimately assimilated into the Zipser ethnic community. During and after the Second World War, most Zipsers evacuated or were expelled to Germany, but a community of speakers remains in Hopgarten; their distinctive dialect is called "Outzäpsersch" (German: "Altzipserisch", literally "Old Zipserish").</p>

<p>A <b>runic inscription</b> is an inscription made in one of the various runic alphabets. The body of  runic inscriptions falls into the three categories of Elder Futhark (some 350 items, dating to between the 2nd and 8th centuries AD), Anglo-Frisian Futhorc (some 100 items, 5th to 11th centuries) and Younger Futhark (close to 6,000 items, 8th to 12th centuries).</p><p>The total 350 known inscriptions in the Elder Futhark script fall into two main geographical categories, North Germanic (Scandinavian, c. 267 items) and Continental or South Germanic ("German" and Gothic, c. 81 items). These inscriptions are on many types of loose objects, but the North Germanic tradition shows a preference for bracteates, while the South Germanic one has a preference for fibulae. The precise figures are debatable because some inscriptions are very short and/or illegible so that it is uncertain whether they qualify as an inscription at all. </p><p>The division into Scandinavian, North Sea (Anglo-Frisian), and South Germanic inscription makes sense from the 5th century. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Elder Futhark script is still in its early phase of development, with inscriptions concentrated in what is now Denmark and Northern Germany. </p><p>The tradition of runic literacy continues in Scandinavia into the Viking Age, developing into the Younger Futhark script. Close to 6,000 Younger Futhark inscriptions are known, many of them on runestones.</p>

However, analysis of dialect relationships  cannot always be clearly depicted by cladistics, since there are often dialect continuum cases and also examples with elements of convergence, as well as division.</p><p>Language atlases serve as an empirical database which document the dialect profile of a large number of locations in detail. Different well-known numerical classification methodologies are used to abstract and visualise a basic pattern from the immense amount of data found in the language atlases. </p><p>Not one solid classification can be expected to result from the calculations; rather, different aspects of the basic pattern being searched for can be discovered by using the different methodologies. Principally speaking, there is more interest in the diversity of the taxometric methodologies, the results and the linguistic interpretations which can be made from them. </p>

<p><b>Raimon de Cornet</b> (<small>Occitan pronunciation: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[rajˈmun de kuɾˈnet]</span>, also spelled <i>Ramon de Cornet</i>; fl. 1324–1340) was a fourteenth-century Toulousain priest, friar, grammarian, poet, and troubadour. He was a prolific author of verse; more than forty of his poems survive, most in Occitan but two in Latin. He also wrote letters, a didactic poem (sometimes classed as the last <i>ensenhamen</i>), a grammar, and some treatises on computation (i.e. practical mathematics). He was the "last of the troubadours" and represented <i>l'esprit le plus brillant</i> (the most brilliant spirit) of the "Toulousain School". He appears in contemporary documents with the titles <i>En</i> (sir, also <i>mossen</i>) and <i>Frare</i> (brother, also <i>fray</i>, <i>frai</i>, or <i>frayre</i>). </p><p>Raimon's <i>magnum opus</i> is his <i>Doctrinal de trobar</i> (doctrines of composition) composed around 1324 and dedicated to Peter IV of Aragon. The <i>Doctrinal</i> follows the grammar put forward later by the Consistori del Gay Saber of Guilhem Molinier and it is structurally identical to Guilhem's <i>Leys d'Amors</i>. Both works spend a good deal of space quoting illustrative passages from the greatest troubadours of the past. The <i>Doctrinal</i> is considered the first work of the <i>Gay Saber</i> tradition. In a passage praising the pleasure of poetry, Raimon lists many of the traditional genres, which he and others like him had helped to define: </p> <p>Raimon strongly supported the Crusaders and bitterly opposed the clergy, Avignon Papacy, and eventually Philip VI of France. He wrote two "Crusade songs". The earlier one was composed in 1332, when Philip VI announced his intention of going on Crusade in July. Raimon suggests that the king should impose a tax on those men who do not join the Crusade, and in any case those who remain in France should pray two or three times daily for those who do go to the Holy Land. He notes that missionaries will inevitably accompany the host and attempt to convert the "Saracens".

While Filipino (Tagalog) has the most number of speakers of Philippine languages, Cebuano had the largest native language-speaking population in the Philippines until about the 1980s.

When India gained independence, eleven braille scripts were in use, in different parts of the country and for different languages. By 1951 a single national standard had been settled on, Bharati braille, which has since been adopted by Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. There are slight differences in the orthographies for Nepali in India and Nepal, and for Tamil in India and Sri Lanka.  There are significant differences in Bengali Braille between India and Bangladesh, with several letters differing.  Pakistan has not adopted Bharati braille, so the Urdu Braille of Pakistan is an entirely different alphabet than the Urdu Braille of India, with their commonalities largely due to their common inheritance from English or International Braille.  Sinhalese Braille largely conforms to other Bharati, but differs significantly toward the end of the alphabet, and is covered in its own article. </p><p>Bharati braille alphabets use a 6-dot cell with values based largely on English Braille. Letters are assigned as consistently as possible across the various regional scripts of India as they are transliterated in the Latin script, so that, for example, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, and English are rendered largely the same in braille. </p>
<p><b>Washback effect</b> refers to the impact of testing on curriculum design, teaching practices, and learning behaviors. The influences of testing can be found in the choices of learners and teachers: teachers may teach directly for specific test preparation, or learners might focus on specific aspects of language learning found in assessments. Washback effect in testing is typically seen as either negative, or positive (sometimes referred to as <i>washforward</i>). Washback may be considered harmful to more fluid approaches in language education where definitions of language ability may be limited; however, it may be considered beneficial when good teaching practices result. Washback can also be positive or negative in that it either maintains or hinders the accomplishment of educational goals. In positive washback, teaching the curriculum becomes the same as teaching to a specific test. Negative washback occurs in situations where there may be a mismatch between the stated goals of instruction and the focus of assessment; it may lead to the abandonment of instructional goals in favor of test preparation.</p><p>The effect of a test on learning and teaching is a concept discussed as early as the 19th century. Research into washback can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the influence of tests on teaching and learning was first seen as a potential source of bias due to the accountability of test feedback loops. As the results of tests became more important to students (gatekeepers to future prospects), teachers (evaluation), schools (funding), and states (lawsuits), test preparation as a function of teaching became essential. Tests were made to be economical, using multiple-choice questions and focusing on psychometric validity, but perhaps not measuring more complex abilities. Schools and teachers were accountable for student test performance, and thus focused on the skills and outcomes that the tests measured. Given the dynamic interaction between testing and education, the term systematic validity was used to refer to the ways in which a test leads to changes in instruction intended to develop cognitive skills that are being measured by a test.<br></p><p>Research has shown the variable extent to which washback influences different individuals in different ways, and the difficulty of targeting washback. Significant variability has been noted in the ways that teachers respond to test changes and classroom assessments. Effects may be superficial, indirect, and unpredictable due to individual differences in the way that learning is mediated by teachers, textbook writers, and publishers.</p>

It is often referred to as 'the archaeology of the book', concerning itself with the materials (parchment, sometimes referred to as membrane or vellum, paper, pigments, inks and so on), and techniques used to make books, including their binding. </p><p>There are no clear-cut definitions: some codicologists say that their field encompasses palaeography, the study of handwriting, while some palaeographers say that their field encompasses codicology. The study of written features such as marginalia, glosses, ownership inscriptions, etc. falls in both camps, as does the study of the physical aspects of decoration, which otherwise belongs to art history. </p><p>By a close examination of the physical attributes of a book, it is sometimes possible to establish the history and provenance of a book, or to match up long-separated elements originally from the same book.  Palaeographers and codicologists may also study the history of libraries, manuscript-collecting and of book-cataloguing. </p>

<p>In computer science, an <b>abstract syntax tree</b> (<b>AST</b>), or just <b>syntax tree</b>, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural, content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches. </p><p>This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated parse trees, which are typically built by a parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., contextual analysis. </p><p>Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program transformation systems. </p>
<p><b>James Evans</b> (January 18, 1801 – November 23, 1846) was an English-Canadian Methodist missionary and amateur linguist. He is best remembered for his creation of the "syllabic" writing system for Ojibwe and Cree, which was later adapted to other languages such as Inuktitut. </p><p>Evans was born in Kingston-upon-Hull in England, but emigrated with his parents to Lower Canada in 1822, where he worked as a teacher. He later moved to Rice Lake and continued his teaching work. </p><p>In 1833 he was ordained as a Wesleyan (Methodist) minister, and in 1840 he was given authority over the local district in Norway House in Manitoba. During this time Evans did his greatest work - the development of the Ojibwe and Cree scripts. Evans had picked up Ojibwe during his work among the people in Upper Canada. He created the Ojibwe script after first trying to apply a Roman script to their language. Later, he modified syllabics slightly and applied it to Cree, a related language. The scripts were based on Devanagari and Pitman Shorthand. They were easy to learn and led to almost universal literacy among the Canadian Ojibwe and Cree within a few years. </p><p>Evans's other missionary work was scarred by turmoil. Evans clashed several times with the Hudson's Bay Company, mostly over their treatment of the native population. Evans accidentally shot and killed his friend and co-worker Thomas Hassall in 1844. He was accused of sexual misconduct with native girls under his care. Although he was acquitted, he was sent to London to defend himself again. The stress took a toll on his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1846. </p><p>James Evans's grave was found in England. Then Evans's remains were cremated and sent to Norway House, Manitoba.</p>

HPF features included: </p> <ul><li>New Fortran statements, such as <code>FORALL</code>, and the ability to create <code>PURE</code> (side effect free) procedures</li> <li>Compiler directives for recommended distributions of array data</li> <li><i>Extrinsic procedure</i> interface for interfacing to non-HPF parallel procedures such as those using message passing</li> <li>Additional library routines - including environmental inquiry, parallel prefix/suffix (e.g., 'scan'), data scattering, and sorting operations</li></ul><p>Fortran 95 incorporated several HPF capabilities.  In response, the HPFF again convened and published the HPF 2.0 Report.  The updated report removed material which was already covered by Fortran 95.  The report was also reorganized and revised based on experience with HPF 1.0. </p><p>While some vendors did incorporate HPF into their compilers in the 1990s, some aspects proved difficult to implement and of questionable use.  Since then, most vendors and users have moved to OpenMP-based parallel processing.  However HPF continues to have influence.  For example, the proposed <code>BIT</code> data type for the upcoming Fortran-2008 standard contains a number of new intrinsic functions taken directly from HPF. </p>

<p>In linguistics, a <b>zero</b> or <b>null</b> is a segment which is not pronounced or written. It is a useful concept in analysis, indicating lack of an element where one might be expected.  It is usually written with the symbol "∅", in Unicode <span><span>U+2205</span></span> <span>∅</span> <span>Empty set</span> (HTML <code>&amp;#8709;</code> <b>·</b>  <code>&amp;empty;</code>). A common ad hoc solution is to use the Scandinavian capital letter Ø instead. </p><p>There are several kinds of zero: </p><p>In phonetics: </p> <ul><li>A <i>null phoneme</i> indicates that no phone is produced where one might be expected. For example, in syllable structure analysis, null onset indicates that a syllable lacks an initial consonant (<i>onset</i>) that is normally required by phonotactics of the considered language. For an example, see Standard Chinese phonology#Zero onset.</li></ul><p>In morphology: </p> <ul><li>A zero morph, consisting of no phonetic form, is an allomorph of a morpheme that is otherwise realized in speech.  In the phrase <i>two sheep-∅</i>, the plural marker is a zero morph, which is an allomorph of <i>-s</i> as in <i>two cow<b>s</b></i>. In the phrase <i>I like-∅ it</i>, the verb conjugation has a zero affix, as opposed to the third-person singular present <i>-s</i> in <i>he like<b>s</b> it</i>.</li> <li>Similarly, a <b>zero inflection</b> is an unrealized inflection, such as in nouns with identical singular and plural forms. For example, plural of <i>sheep</i> can be analyzed as <i>sheep-∅</i>.</li></ul><p>In grammar: </p> <ul><li>A zero pronoun occurs in some languages. In the English sentence <i>nobody knows ∅</i> the zero pronoun plays the role of the object of the verb, and in <i>∅ makes no difference</i> it plays the role of the subject.  Likewise, the zero pronoun in <i>the book ∅ I am reading</i> plays the role of the relative pronoun <i>that</i> in <i>the book that I am reading</i>. In generative grammar, this is also referred to as PRO. In pronoun-dropping languages, including null subject languages such as most Romance languages, the zero pronoun is a prominent feature.</li> <li>A zero subordinate conjunction occurs in English in sentences like <i>I know ∅ he likes me</i>, in which the zero conjunction plays the role of the subordinate conjunction <i>that</i> in <i>I know that he likes me</i>. This comes naturally to native speakers of English, but some non-native learners of English have to consciously adjust to it, as their native languages rarely do it.</li> <li>A <b>zero article</b> is an unrealized indefinite or definite article in some languages.</li> <li>A zero copula, in which a copula such as the verb <i>to be</i> is implied but absent. For example, in Russian the copula is usually omitted in the present tense, as in "Она красивая" (literally: <i>She beautiful</i>), the same happening with colloquial Brazilian Portuguese, as in "irônicos, aqueles" (literally: <i>ironic, those</i> [guys]), though never with the adjective coming after the subject as usual in Romance languages. In English the copula is sometimes omitted in some nonstandard dialects.</li></ul>

All of these dialects had their origins in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, although some have become effectively dormant since the time of emigration. Even in Cape Breton, the situation of the language is precarious.</p><p>Scottish Gaels settled in Nova Scotia commencing in 1773 with the arrival of the Ship Hector and continuing up until the 1850s.  Gaelic has been spoken for 241 years in Nova Scotia: on Cape Breton Island and on the northeastern Nova Scotia mainland. During the early 1900s, the Gaelic language was nearly wiped out in Canadian schools. </p><p>The Gaelic cultural identity community is a vibrant part of Nova Scotia's diverse peoples and communities. Thousands of Nova Scotians attend Gaelic-related activities and events annually including: language workshops and immersions, milling frolics, square dances, fiddle and piping sessions, concerts and festivals. Up until about the turn of the 20th century, Gaelic was widely spoken on eastern Prince Edward Island (PEI). In the 2011 Canadian Census, 10 individuals in PEI cited that their mother tongue was a Gaelic language, with over 90 claiming to speak a Gaelic language. </p><p>Gaels, their language and culture have influenced the heritage of Glengarry County and other regions in present-day Ontario, where many Highland Scots settled commencing in the 18th century, and to a much lesser extent the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador (especially the Codroy Valley), Manitoba and Alberta. Gaelic-speaking poets in communities across Canada have produced a large and significant branch of Gaelic literature comparable to that of Scotland itself.</p><p>Having its origins in Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic language is similar to, but should not be confused with, the Irish language in Newfoundland. </p><p>At its peak in the mid-19th century, Scottish Gaelic, considered together with the closely related Newfoundland Irish, was the third most spoken language in Canada after English and French.</p><p>In Atlantic Canada today, there are currently approximately 2,000 speakers, mainly in Nova Scotia. In terms of the total number of speakers in the 2011 census, there were 7,195 total speakers of "Gaelic languages" in Canada, with 1,365 in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island where the responses mainly refer to Scottish Gaelic. The 2011 census also reported that over 300 residents of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island considered a Gaelic language to be their "mother tongue".</p>

Other names for the language are <i>Vengi, Pengo, Ngo, Nguu, Ngwa, Nge</i>. </p><p>Vengo is spoken by about 14,000 people. Because the Babungo people all live closely together and concentrate only in and around Vengo village, there are only small dialectical variations in their speech, which are negligible. </p><p>As it is the case for other Bantu languages except Swahili, the Vengo language uses different tone pitches, which form a distinctive feature for the meaning of the words. Babungo has even got a very complex tone system: So for the vowels there are eight distinctive pitch types or pitch sequences: high, mid, low, high-mid, high-low, low-falling, low-high, low-high-mid. </p><p>More and more people originally descending from the Babungo tribe are not able to speak the Babungo language any more. In most cases, those people acquire English as mother tongue, if they stay predominantly in the anglophone Northwest of Cameroon, otherwise French if they orient themselves towards the francophone parts of Cameroon. Most of the people in Western Cameroon speak Cameroonian Pidgin English anyway. Because more and more Babungo people distance themselves from the traditional Babungo way of life, and since there are not insignificant socio-culturally caused problems in that region, Babungo may belong to the languages threatened by extinction in the not too far future. </p>

The Luyana people originally migrated south from the Kingdom of Luba and Kingdom of Lunda in the Katanga area of the Congo River basin, either  late in the 17th century or early in the 18th century. The language they spoke, therefore, was closely related to Luba and Lunda.

This film also ended the struggling period for Bachchan, and turned him into a rising star. The film was a blockbuster success, domestically in India and overseas in the Soviet Union. </p><p>It was the first of many collaborations between screenwriter duo Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan. Ever since <i>Zanjeer</i>, Salim-Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as <i>Deewaar</i> (1975) and <i>Sholay</i> (1975), establishing Bachchan as a superstar. In addition to being a turning point for Bachchan's career and Hindi cinema, <i>Zanjeer</i> was also a turning point for South Indian cinema, with Bachchan's acting inspiring future Tamil film star Rajinikanth. <i>Zanjeer</i> remains an important film in the history of Indian cinema and is regarded as a classic today. </p>

<p><b>Gerardus Johannes Geers</b>, (Delft, 10 December 1891 – Groningen, the 2 May 1965), was a Dutch linguist and Hispanist. He wrote his thesis on the language of the Blackfoot Indians in North America but spent his career studying the Spanish language and Spanish culture. </p><p>In 1917 Geers travelled to Spain to become the governor of the children of the Dutch envoy in Madrid. He mingled in leftist intellectual circles and translated Das Kapital in Spanish. Under the pseudonym of Cayo Graco he published articles in socialist periodics like Nuestra Palabra and El Comunista. Despite his diplomatic immunity as part of the household of the envoy he was expelled from Spain for alleged "subversive activities". </p><p>Geers made a career as a teacher and became a pioneer of hispanismo in the Netherlands. He translated Cervantes, Unamuno, Ortega y Gasset and Diez del Corral. As an hispanist he criticized the popular "Leyenda negra" and he defended King Philip II of Spain against the many accusitions. </p><p>In "El problema de los romances" (1920) Geers denied the popular thesis of Milá y Fontanals en Menéndez Pelayo that the Spanish literary romances were descended from the Spanish epic works. Geers proposed that they stood in the tradition of the middle-Latin lyrics. Geers thesis was falsified by E. García Gómez in his article "La lírica hispano-árabe y la aparición de la lírica románica" (Al-Andalus, XXI (1956)) based on recently discovered kharga-material. </p><p>Geers became a professor of Hispanic studies in Groningen. </p>
<p><b>Ubang</b> is a Bendi language of Nigeria. It is notable for having male and female forms.</p><p>The differences are far greater than, for example, British and American versions of English. But both men and women are able to understand each other perfectly - or as well as anywhere else in the world. Boys grow up speaking the female language, as they spend most of their childhoods with their mothers and other women. At the age of 10, however, boys are expected to speak the "male language". If a they do not switch to the correct language by a certain age, they are considered "abnormal".</p><p>Ubang people are very proud of the language difference and regard it as a sign of their uniqueness. It is seen as "a blessing from God" and they offer a Biblical explanation for why it has evolved, As more young people leave the community and the English language becomes more popular, however, there are concerns that it will not survive. The two sexes understand each other, but only use the language of their own sex. It is unclear exactly what proportion of words are different in the two languages and there is no pattern, such as whether the words are commonly used, related or linked to traditional roles for men or women. Anthropologist Chi Chi Undie, who has studied the community, has said: "It's almost like two different lexicons… There are a lot of words that men and women share in common, then there are others which are totally different depending on your sex. They don't sound alike, they don't have the same letters, they are completely different words."</p>

The first published material written fully in the <b>Lun Bawang language</b> is a translation of the Bible in 1982, which is called <i>Bala Luk Do</i>. A Lun Bawang–English dictionary was constructed in 1969 by the University of Washington. A dialect of the Lun Bawang language, Kemaloh Lundayeh, was recently (2006) compiled into a bilingual dictionary of Lundayeh language and English. The Lun Bawang language is mainly an oral language. There is very little printed written material in this language that was not written by missionaries or linguists.

<p><b>FuzzyCLIPS</b> is a fuzzy logic extension of the CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) expert system shell from NASA. It was developed by the Integrated Reasoning Group of the Institute for Information Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and has been widely distributed for a number of years. It enhances CLIPS by providing a fuzzy reasoning capability that is fully integrated with CLIPS facts and inference engine allowing one to represent and manipulate fuzzy facts and rules. FuzzyCLIPS can deal with exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an expert system. The system uses two basic inexact concepts, fuzziness and uncertainty. It has provided a useful environment for developing fuzzy applications but it does require significant effort to update and maintain as new versions of CLIPS are released. </p>
<p><b>Angevin</b> is the traditional <i>langue d'oïl</i> spoken in Anjou, a historic province in western France. It was also spoken in neighboring regions like the Pays Nantais (along with Gallo), Maine (along with Mayennois) and Touraine (along with Tourangeau). </p><p>It is closely related to other <i>oïl</i> dialects spoken in western France, especially Sarthois, Mayennois and Norman (south of ligne Joret) in what could be called Eastern Armorican (Angevin-Mayennois-Sarthois-South Norman). Eastern Armorican, together with Gallo, forms the "zone armoricaine" of Langues d'oïl.  As an <i>oïl</i> language or dialect it shares many common features with French in vocabulary, phonemes and daily expressions. </p><p>It is also similar to the Gallo language (although Gallo has a stronger Celtic linguistic substrate that comes from Breton and not only from ancient Gaulish language). Angevin influenced the origin and development of Gallo in the Marches of Neustria (especially in the Breton March) beginning in the 9th and 10th centuries. </p><p>Angevin was the old speech of the Angevins or House of Plantagenet. However, in spite of this prestigious dynasty, Angevin never developed a notable literature, partially because the region of Anjou was integrated into the royal domains of the King of France (from the House of Capet) at the beginning of the 13th century, where the literary language was Parisian based Francien. </p><p>Some words of Angevin origin were borrowed to English via Anglo-Norman at the Angevins domination of England.</p><p>Today it is almost an extinct dialect or language but it is preserved in the Rimiaux, poems written in Angevin, and also in some daily expressions.</p>

Baybayin is an indigenous Indic script that has been widely used in traditional Tagalog domains. It is one of the many <i>suyat</i> scripts in the Philippines. It continued to be used during the early part of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines until largely being supplanted by usage of the Latin alphabet. Baybayin is well known because it was carefully documented by scribes during the colonial era. </p><p>The term <i>baybayín</i> literally means "to spell, write, and syllabize" in Tagalog. Baybayin was extensively documented by the Spanish. Some have incorrectly attributed the name <i>Alibata</i> to it, but that term was coined by Paul Rodríguez Verzosa after the arrangement of letters of the Arabic alphabet (alif, ba, ta (alibata), "f" having been eliminated for euphony's sake).</p><p>It is one of a number of individual writing systems used in Southeast Asia, nearly all of which are abugidas where any consonant is pronounced with the inherent vowel <i>a</i> following it—diacritics being used to express other vowels. Many of these writing systems descended from ancient alphabets used in India over 2000 years ago. Recent studies have showed that it predates the arrival of the Spanish.</p><p>The Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, one of the largest archives in the Philippines, currently possesses the world’s biggest collection of ancient writings in Baybayin script.

<p>A <b>non-convergent discourse</b> (NCD) is a discourse in which the participants do not converge in their language, which results in the use of different languages. Alternative names for this phenomenon are asymmetric and bilingual discourse. </p><p>The term was introduced by the sociologist Reitze Jonkman. He distinguishes two motivations for people to engage in an NCD: </p> <ul><li>Insufficient active knowledge of the other participants' language, combined with a good passive knowledge. It usually takes longer for a person learning a foreign language to speak it fluently than to understand it when it is being spoken. This type of NCD is common in the Germanic languages of the Scandinavian-Nordic region of Europe, where the differences between Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish are relatively small, and do not necessarily obstruct use of the participants' native languages. The same occurs between speakers of Dutch and Afrikaans and to a lesser degree between speakers of Italian and Spanish, Portuguese and Spanish (and their respective variants), where it is also possible to understand what the other person is saying as long as it is said slowly; (as such between residents of Spain and Portugal as well as between residents of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries). Also, it is possible among speakers of various South-Slavic languages. For instance, a Serbian tourist in Macedonia or Bulgaria will often be able to communicate with locals without ever having studied Bulgarian or Macedonian. Another good example would be north India - Users of Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Gujrati understand each other very well while speaking their mother tongue. In East India, Bengali and Assamese speakers can usually understand one another's speech. Also in South India, Tamil and Malayalam Speakers are often able to understand each other and converse in their native languages to each other while understanding the bulk of the conversation.  In some areas where bilingualism is common, this can also be done with languages that are not mutually intelligible if both speakers are assumed to understand the other's language, as is the case in cities like Montreal.</li> <li>Ethnic marking: the use of a preferred variety, in order to stress one's belonging to a certain cultural or ethnic group. This occurs in Northern Germany, for example, where speakers of Low German and standard German do not converge.</li></ul><p>A third motivation for engaging in an NCD lies on the personal level. According to Giles' Communication Accommodation Theory, interpersonal contacts are negotiations. In a discourse, people seek to create understanding by stressing common features. However, when this will for creating understanding is not present (for example, in cases where the participants feel a strong dislike for each other), they dissociate from each other by stressing the differences. The use of different languages might be the result of such a dissociation strategy. </p><p>Sometimes the motivation for engaging in an NCD is misunderstood, especially in contexts where they are uncommon. NCD participants with an ethnic marking strategy might be wrongly interpreted as if they were expressing dislike. This type of misunderstanding is especially common among speakers who come from monolingual areas and find themselves in a bilingual area, where a second language is used alongside their own and NCDs are common. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>A <b>diaphoneme</b> is an abstract phonological unit that identifies a correspondence between related sounds of two or more varieties of a language or language cluster. For example, some English varieties contrast the vowel of <i>late</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/eː/</span>) with that of <i>wait</i> or <i>eight</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɛɪ/</span>). Other English varieties contrast the vowel of <i>late</i> or <i>wait</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/eː/</span>) with that of <i>eight</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɛɪ/</span>). This non-overlapping pair of phonemes from two different varieties can be reconciled by positing three different diaphonemes: A first diaphoneme for words like <i>late</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">//e//</span>), a second diaphoneme for words like <i>wait</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">//ei//</span>), and a third diaphoneme for words like <i>eight</i> (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">//ex//</span>). </p> <p><b>Diaphonology</b> studies the realization of diaphones across dialects, and is important if an orthography is to be adequate for more than one dialect of a language.

It has since spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France and the Arab world. It is most closely associated with Morocco and in Spanish is known simply as "Moorish tea", <i>té moruno</i>. A similar drink is prepared in Spain but is typically served chilled as iced tea in the summer, instead of hot year-round. As a combination of imported ingredients (tea from China and originally imported sugar) and a local ingredient (fresh mint), it is an early example of globalization in cuisine. </p><p>Mint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb. The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity, with tea bars filling a similar social function to coffee drinking establishments in Europe and North America. The spearmint cultivar <i>Mentha spicata</i> 'Nana' possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. Other hybrids and cultivars of <i>Mentha</i>, including <i>yerba buena</i>, are occasionally used as substitutes for Nana mint. In Morocco, people enjoy perfuming their Moroccan mint tea with herbs and flowers. For fancy occasions, they like adding orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like Pennyroyal mint and absinthe. </p>

More specifically, it is part of the Northwest Semitic group, which also includes the Canaanite languages such as Hebrew and Phoenician. The Aramaic alphabet was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic alphabets. During its approximately 3,100 years of written history, Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires and as a language of divine worship, religious study and as the spoken tongue of a number of Semitic peoples from the Near East. </p><p>Historically, Aramaic was the language of the Arameans, a Semitic-speaking people of the region around between the northern Levant and the northern Euphrates valley. By around 1000 BCE, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of western Syria. Aramaic rose to prominence under the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BCE), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language, and its use spread throughout most of Mesopotamia and the Levant. At its height, variants of Aramaic were spoken all over in what is today Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait, Eastern Arabia, Northern Arabia, and to a lesser extent parts of southeast and south central Turkey, and parts of northwest Iran. Aramaic was the language of Jesus, who spoke the Galilean dialect during his public ministry, as well as the language of large sections of the biblical books of Daniel and Ezra, and also one of the languages of the Talmud. </p><p>The scribes of the Neo-Assyrian bureaucracy had also used Aramaic, and this practice—together with other administrative practices—was subsequently inherited by the succeeding Neo-Babylonians (605–539 BC), and the Achaemenids (539–323 BC). Mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language, highly standardized <i>written</i> Aramaic (in its Achaemenid form called Imperial Aramaic) progressively also become the <i>lingua franca</i> of trade and commerce throughout the Achaemenid territories, which extended as far east as the Indus valley. (That use of <i>written</i> Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the Aramaic alphabet and—as logograms—some Aramaic vocabulary in the Pahlavi scripts, which were used by several Middle Iranian languages, including Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, and Khwarazmian.)</p><p>Aramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties, which are sometimes considered dialects, though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered as separate languages. Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken Eastern Aramaic and Mandaic forms are today largely restricted to Iraqi Kurdistan, northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey, whilst the severely endangered Western Neo-Aramaic is spoken by small communities in northwestern Syria. </p><p>Certain dialects of Aramaic are also retained as a sacred language by certain religious communities. One of those liturgical dialects is Mandaic, which besides being a living variant of Aramaic is also the liturgical language of Mandaeism. Significantly more widespread is Syriac, the liturgical language of Syriac Christianity, in particular the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Assyrian Evangelical Church, Ancient Church of the East, Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Church, and the Saint Thomas Christian denominations of India. Syriac was also the liturgical language of several now-extinct gnostic faiths, such as Manichaeism. </p><p>Neo-Aramaic languages are still spoken today as a first language by many communities of Syriac Christians, Jews, and Mandaeans of Western Asia, most numerously by Assyrians with numbers of fluent speakers among Assyrian people ranging from approximately 575,000 to 1,000,000, with the main languages among Assyrians being Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (235,000 speakers), Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (216,000 speakers) and Turoyo (112,000 to 450,000 speakers), together with a number of smaller closely related languages with no more than 5,000 to 10,000 speakers between them. They have retained use of the once dominant lingua franca despite subsequent language shifts experienced throughout the Middle East. However, the Aramaic languages are now considered endangered. The languages are used by the older generation, all beyond retirement age, and so could go extinct within a generation. However, researchers are working to record all the dialects of Neo-Aramaic languages before they go extinct. Royal Aramaic inscriptions from the Aramean city-states date from 10th century BC, making Aramaic one of the world's oldest recorded living languages.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The letter <span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text"><b>ϸ</b></span> (sometimes called <b>sho</b> or <b>san</b>) was a letter added to the Greek alphabet in order to write the Bactrian language.

<p>The <b>Phoenician alphabet</b>, called by convention the <b>Proto-Canaanite alphabet</b> for inscriptions older than around 1050 BC, is the oldest verified alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is an abjad consisting of 22 letters, all consonants, with<i> matres lectionis</i> used for some vowels in certain late varieties. It was used for the writing of Phoenician, a Northern Semitic language, used by the civilization of Phoenicia. </p><p>The Phoenician alphabet is derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs. It became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it evolved and was assimilated by many other cultures. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet is a local variant of the Phoenician alphabetical script. Another derivative script is the Aramaic alphabet, which was the ancestor of the modern Arabic script. The Modern Hebrew script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic script. The Greek alphabet (and by extension its descendants, such as Latin, Cyrillic, Runic, and Coptic) was also derived from Phoenician. </p><p>As the letters were originally incised with a stylus, most of the shapes are angular and straight, although more cursive versions are increasingly attested in later times, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet of Roman-era North Africa. Phoenician was usually written from right to left, although there are some texts written in boustrophedon. </p>

<p><b>Conjunctive grammars</b> are a class of formal grammars studied in formal language theory. They extend the basic type of grammars, the context-free grammars, with a conjunction operation. Besides explicit conjunction, conjunctive grammars allow implicit disjunction represented by multiple rules for a single nonterminal symbol, which is the only logical connective expressible in context-free grammars. Conjunction can be used, in particular, to specify intersection of languages. A further extension of conjunctive grammars known as Boolean grammars additionally allows explicit negation. </p><p>The rules of a conjunctive grammar are of the form </p> <dl><dd><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle A\to \alpha _{1}\And \ldots \And \alpha _{m}}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mi>A</mi>         <mo stretchy="false">→</mo>         <msub>           <mi>α</mi>           <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">             <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>         </msub>         <mi mathvariant="normal">&amp;</mi>         <mo>…</mo>         <mi mathvariant="normal">&amp;</mi>         <msub>           <mi>α</mi>           <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">             <mi>m</mi>           </mrow>         </msub>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle A\to \alpha _{1}\And \ldots \And \alpha _{m}}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span></dd></dl><p>where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle A}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mi>A</mi>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle A}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span> is a nonterminal and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle \alpha _{1}}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <msub>           <mi>α</mi>           <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">             <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>         </msub>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \alpha _{1}}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span>, ..., <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle \alpha _{m}}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <msub>           <mi>α</mi>           <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">             <mi>m</mi>           </mrow>         </msub>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \alpha _{m}}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span> are strings formed of symbols in <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle \Sigma }">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle \Sigma }</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="{\displaystyle N}">   <semantics>     <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD">       <mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0">         <mi>N</mi>       </mstyle>     </mrow>     <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle N}</annotation>   </semantics></math></span></span> (finite sets of terminal and nonterminal symbols respectively).

He joined the University in 1966 as a member of the Department of Anthropology, transferring to the Department of Linguistics in 1982 and now working at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI). He is best known for his work with anthropologist Brent Berlin on colour: <i>Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution</i> (1969) ISBN 1-57586-162-3. More recently, he has worked in the area of Construction Grammar with Charles J. Fillmore, authoring the textbook <i>Construction Grammar</i> (1996 manuscript). He is currently working on an extension of Construction Grammar called Sign-Based Construction Grammar, authoring a book on this topic with Charles J. Fillmore, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis. </p><p>Since 2005 Kay has returned to experimental testing of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and his findings show that taking into account brain lateralization allows another perspective on the debate.

<p><b>Damu</b> is a poorly documented Tani (Sino-Tibetan) language spoken in Tibet. Only 80 speakers of this language were reported to exist in 1985, and to be experiencing strong language contact with speakers of Bodic languages. No documentation or description of the Damu language other than some brief remarks and a wordlist in Ouyang (1985) appears to exist, and it is not known whether the Damu community is still intact and speaking their language. </p><p>The precise genetic affiliation of Damu remains unclear. Although Sun (1993) clearly identified Damu as a member of the Tani languages, he noted some difficulties that prevented its precise alignment within either Western Tani or Eastern Tani. In addition, Sun speculated that Damu might represent a northern variety of the Tangam language. Post (2013a) concluded that Tangam and Damu are in fact distinct, despite sharing a number of features. In particular, both Tangam and Damu share an early sound change which would suggest aligning them with Western Tani, despite sharing an overall Eastern Tani–like profile.</p>

<p><b>Clojure</b> (<span></span>, like <i>closure</i>) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language. Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java virtual machine and the Common Language Runtime. There is a dialect, developed in lockstep with Clojure, called ClojureScript, that compiles to ECMAScript 3. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system. The current development process is community-driven, overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).</p><p>Clojure encourages immutability and immutable data structures. While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of gradual typing. Clojure encourages programmers to be explicit about managing state and identity. This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs is intended to facilitate developing more robust programs, especially multithreaded ones.</p><p>Clojure is used in industry by firms such as Funding Circle, Walmart, Puppet, and other large software firms. Commercial support for Clojure is provided by Cognitect. Annual Clojure conferences are organised every year across the globe, the most famous of them being Clojure/conj (US east coast), Clojure/West (US west coast), and EuroClojure (Europe).</p><p>The latest stable version of Clojure is 1.9, released on December 8, 2017. The first stable release was version 1.0, released on May 4, 2009. Clojure is free software released under the Eclipse Public License.</p>

<p><b>Esperanto II</b> or <b>Esperanto 2</b> was a reform of Esperanto proposed by René de Saussure in 1937, the last of a long series of such proposals beginning with a 1907 response to Ido later called Antido 1. Esperanto II was one of several languages investigated by the International Auxiliary Language Association, the linguistic research body that eventually standardized and presented Interlingua de IALA. </p><p>Several of the grammatical inflections were changed. The accusative is in <i>-u,</i> which replaces the final vowel of nouns, pronouns, and correlatives <i>(ju</i> for <i>ĝin, tu</i> for <i>tion),</i> and for the plural <i>-n</i> is added to both nouns and pronouns <i>(lin</i> "they", <i>lina</i> "their"). Neither suffix affects adjectives, which do not agree with their noun. The correlative series <i>tiu, ĉiu</i> becomes <i>ta, cha</i> when modifying a noun. The indefinite suffix <i>-aŭ</i> is replaced with adverbial <i>-e,</i> and the inchoative <i>-iĝ-</i> becomes <i>-ev-.</i> </p><p>A large number of small grammatical words are also replaced, such as <i>ey</i> for <i>kaj</i> "and", <i>be</i> for <i>ĉe</i> "at", and <i>ki</i> for <i>ol</i> "than". The work of the preposition <i>de</i> "of, by, from" is divided up into several more specific prepositions. </p><p>Additionally, the project introduced international cognates when such cognates were readily recognized; for example, <i>skolo</i> was used for "school" in place of standard Esperanto's <i>lernejo</i> (a derivation of <i>lerni</i>, "to learn"). <i>Skolo</i> has since been adopted by Esperanto in the sense of "a school of thought", which is how it is used in the passage below. Antonymic roots such as <i>tarde</i> for <i>malfrue</i> "late" and <i>poke</i> for <i>malmulte</i> "few" are used today in Esperanto poetry, though they resemble Ido and Esperanto may have acquired them from that language. </p>

<p><b>AWK</b> is a programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. </p><p>The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the string datatype, associative arrays (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and regular expressions. While AWK has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one-liner programs, the language is Turing-complete, and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs.</p><p>AWK was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s, and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors—Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. The acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird auk (which acts as an emblem of the language such as on <i>The AWK Programming Language</i> book cover – the book is often referred to by the abbreviation <i>TAPL</i>). When written in all lowercase letters, as <code>awk</code>, it refers to the Unix or Plan 9 program that runs scripts written in the AWK programming language. </p>

<p>In mathematics, computer science, and logic, <b>rewriting</b> covers a wide range of (potentially non-deterministic) methods of replacing subterms of a formula with other terms. The objects of focus for this article include <b>rewriting systems</b> (also known as <b>rewrite systems</b>, <b>rewrite engines</b> or <b>reduction systems</b>). In their most basic form, they consist of a set of objects, plus relations on how to transform those objects. </p><p>Rewriting can be non-deterministic. One rule to rewrite a term could be applied in many different ways to that term, or more than one rule could be applicable. Rewriting systems then do not provide an algorithm for changing one term to another, but a set of possible rule applications. When combined with an appropriate algorithm, however, rewrite systems can be viewed as computer programs, and several theorem provers and declarative programming languages are based on term rewriting.</p>

<p><b>Generative Lexicon</b> (GL) is a theory  of linguistic semantics which focuses on the distributed nature of   compositionality in natural language. The first major work outlining the framework is James Pustejovsky's "Generative Lexicon" (1991). Subsequent important developments are presented in Pustejovsky and Boguraev (1993), Bouillon (1997), and Busa (1996). The first unified treatment of GL was given in Pustejovsky (1995). Unlike purely verb-based approaches to compositionality, Generative Lexicon attempts to spread the semantic load  across all constituents of the utterance.  Central to the philosophical perspective of GL  are two major lines of inquiry: (1) How is it that we are able to deploy a finite number of words in our language in an unbounded number of contexts? (2) Is lexical information and the representations used in composing meanings separable from our commonsense knowledge? </p>

<p><b>Andrea Carlo Moro</b> (born July 24, 1962) is an Italian linguist and neuroscientist. </p><p>He is currently full professor of general linguistics at the Institute for Advanced Study IUSS Pavia, Italy, founder and former director of NeTS and of the Department of Cognitive Behavioural and Social Sciences. His main fields of research are syntax and neurolinguistics. His has pursued at least two distinct lines of research: the theory of syntax and the neurological correlates of syntax with the brain. For the first field, see the critical comments in Graffi (2000), Hale - Keyser (2003), Kayne (2011), Richards (2010) and Chomsky (2013) among others. As for a critical evaluation of the second field see in particular the first chapter of Kandel et al. (2013); see also Kaan, 2002, Marcus 2003 and Newmeyer (2005). By referring to these sources, one can synthetically outline Andrea Moro's work in the two fields as follows. </p><p>In the first field, he contributed to the theory of clause structure (in particular with respect to the theory of the copula discovering inverse copular constructions, to the notion of expletive proposing that an element like "there" and its equivalent across languages is a raised expletive predicate rather than an inserted expletive subject, and to the theory of syntactic movement (by proposing a weak version of the theory of antisymmetry, i.e. dynamic antisymmetry) according to which movement is the effect of a symmetry-breaking process in the computational system that underlies syntax. As for the first topic the original reference is the volume "The Raising of Predicates" (1997, Cambridge University Press) - chapter 1 and 2, in particular - which has received more than 900 citations, according to Google Scholar, whose popularised version is now accessible in English as "A Brief History of the verb to BE" (2017, MIT Press); as for the second, instead, the original reference is the monograph "Dynamic Antisymmetry" (MIT Press) which has received circa 500 references, again according to Google Scholar.</p><p>As for the other field, he explored the neurological correlates of artificial languages which do not follow the principles of Universal Grammar providing evidence that Universal Grammar properties cannot be cultural, social or conventional artifacts: in fact, he and the team of people he worked with showed that recursive syntactic rules, that is rules based on recursion selectively activate a neurological network (including Broca's area) whereas non-recursive syntactic rules do not. These discoveries have appeared in a few international Journals, including, for example, Nature Neuroscience (Musso, Moro et al. 2003) or PNAS (Moro 2010): a comprehensive collection of the works in both fields has now become available in the "Routledge Leading Linguist Series" as "The Equilibrium of Human Syntax" (Routledge 2013). He also explored the correlates between the representation of the world in the brain and the structure of syntax, specifically the relationship between sentential negation and the brain) also available in Moro 2013. In recent papers he took position against the idea that the sequence of human actions can be described as having the same structure as the sequence of words in a well-formed syntactic structure.  Furthermore, Moro pursued the study of the relationship between the brain and language by exploiting electrophysiological measure. The core of the experiment - done in a team with neurosurgeons and electric engineers - consists in comparing the shape of the electric waves of non-acoustic language areas (typically, Broca's area) with the shape of the corresponding sound waves. The result was that not only the shape of the two different waves correlate but they do so also in absence of sound production, that is during inner speech activity, opening the possibility to reading linguistic expression from direct measure of the cortex and skipping the actual utterance of the sentence.  For a non technical synthesis of these discoveries and a critical discussion see "Impossible Languages" which received the honourable mention at the Prose Awards. For Moro's view on the relationship between mind and language and for evolution of language and related issues see Everaert et al. (2017) and Friederici et al. (2017). </p><p>His first novel is "Il segreto di Pietramala" a thriller concerning a lost language. For this novel, Andrea Moro was awarded the Flaiano Prizes (Italian: <i lang="it">Premi Flaiano</i>) for literature in July 2018. </p>

<p><b>Uyaquq</b> (also <b>Uyaquk</b> or <b>Uyakoq</b>; sometimes referred to in English as <b>Helper Neck</b>) (ca. 1860–1924) was a member of the Yupik native American group who became a Helper in the Moravian Church, noted for his linguistic genius. He went from being an illiterate adult to inventing a series of writing systems for his native language and then producing translations of the Bible and other religious works in a period of five years.</p><p>Uyaquq was born into a family of shamans in the lower Kuskokwim River valley of central Alaska in the mid-1860s. Even by the standards of the day, Uyaquk was a small man.  He became a shaman in early adulthood, but converted to Christianity after his father converted.  Although his father became a Russian Orthodox, Uyaquk became a leader and missionary in the Alaskan Moravian Church.  His name means "Neck" in English and he was called that by some English speakers. </p><p>As a missionary, Uyaquq is said to have converted whole villages of Yupik in the lower Kuskokwim River valley to Christianity.  He is said to have had a gentle personality and have been a very erudite speaker. </p><p>Uyaquq was fascinated by the idea that the English-speaking Moravians could quote a passage of scripture several times using exactly the same words each time.  He discovered that they accomplished this by reading from a written text.  Uyaquk became fascinated with the idea of writing and, according to his descendants, received the idea for the first version of the script he used to write his dialect, Yugtun, in a dream. </p><p>Reverend John Hinz, a Moravian missionary in Alaska, and an accomplished linguist, was astonished upon hearing of Uyaquq's invention.  Hinz took Uyaquq to the Bethel mission house so that he could continue his linguistic work.  Uyaquq is said to have written constantly during the trip, writing as many stories from the Bible as he could in the new script without stopping to sleep.  Hinz and the Kilbucks aided Uyaquq by telling him scriptures, but Uyaquq refused to learn to read or write English, as he thought that English literacy would make him lose his identity as a Yupik. </p><p>In the next five years, Uyaquq's Yugtun script evolved from its original form of pictographs to a syllabary.  This evolution began when Uyaquq decided that his hieroglyphics were a good memory aid but they did not represent passages with enough accuracy that they could be reproduced verbatim time after time.  Uyaquq identified the concept of a syllable and his script evolved in five stages until he had created a symbol for each syllable in the language.  Each of the five steps was documented in several notebooks kept by Uyaquq.  He taught his writing system to several of his missionary helpers and they used it in their church work. </p><p>Although the system adopted by most people for writing Yupik was the Roman-based script of Reverend Hinz, and, in about 1970, the University of Alaska system, Uyaquq's system has been studied because it may represent the same process of evolution from illiteracy to proto-writing to syllabary taken by many ancient written languages, like Chinese and Egyptian, but compressed into a period of five years.  Uyaquq's notebooks and the writings of those who watched him at work have been the subject of research, beginning with Dr. Alfred Schmitt in the 1930s.</p>

<p> <b>Text linguistics</b> is a branch of linguistics that deals with texts as communication systems. Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text grammars. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i. e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its addressee are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of discourse analysis at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word. </p>

<p><i><b>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language</b></i> is a 1997 book by Douglas Hofstadter in which he explores the meaning, strengths, failings, and beauty of translation. The book is a long and detailed examination of one short translation of a minor French poem, and through that an examination of the mysteries of translation (and indeed more generally, language and consciousness) itself.  Hofstadter himself refers to it as "<i>my ruminations on the art of translation</i>". </p><p>The title itself is a pun, revealing many of the themes of the work: <i>le ton beau</i> means ‘the beautiful tone’ or ‘the sweet tone’, but the word order is unusual for French. It would be more common to write <i>le beau ton</i>. A French speaker hearing the title spoken would be more likely to interpret it as <i>le tombeau de Marot</i>; where <i>tombeau</i> may mean ‘tomb’ (as per the cover picture), but also ‘a work of art (literature or music) done in memory and homage to a deceased person’. (The title is intended to parallel the title of Maurice Ravel's <i>Le Tombeau de Couperin</i>.) In a further play on the title, Hofstadter refers to his deceased wife, to whom the book is dedicated, as <i>ma rose</i> ("my rose"), and to himself as <i>ton beau</i> ("your dear"). </p><p>At the surface level, the book treats the difficulties and rewards of translating works (particularly poetry) from one language to another. Diverse translations (usually to English) of a short poem in Renaissance French, Clément Marot's <i>A une Damoyselle malade</i> (referred to as ‘<i>Ma mignonne</i>’ by Hofstadter), serve as reference points for his ideas on the subject. Groups of translations alternate with analysis and commentary on the same throughout the book. However, Hofstadter's reading of the idea of ‘translation’ goes deeper than simply that of translating between languages. Translation between frames of reference—languages, cultures, modes of expression, or indeed between one person's thoughts and another—becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works, such as reference and self-reference, structure and function, and artificial intelligence. </p><p>One theme of this book is the loss of Hofstadter's wife Carol, who died of a brain tumor while the book was being written; she also created one of the numerous translations of Marot's poem presented in the book. In this context the poem dedicated to ‘a sick lady’ gained yet another deeply tragic and personal meaning, even though the translations were started long before her illness was even known.  (Hofstadter went on to follow with an even more personal book titled <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i> after the death of his wife.) </p>
<p><b>Kazukuru</b> is an extinct language that was once spoken in New Georgia, Solomon Islands. The Dororo and Guliguli languages (if they even existed) were transcriptional variants, dialects, or closely related. The speakers of Kazukuru gradually merged with the Roviana people from the sixteenth century onward, and adopted Roviana as their language.  Kazukuru was last recorded in the early twentieth century when its speakers were in the last stages of language shift. Today, Kazukuru is the name of a clan in the Roviana people group. </p><p>Most of what is known about Kazukuru was collected by W.H.L. Waterhouse and published with S.H. Ray in an article in 1931. Some additional Kazukuru data and the only information on Dororo and Guliguli (two short wordlists) were published by Peter Lanyon-Orgill in 1953. Davis (2003) is skeptical that Guliguli ever existed, since the word <i>guliguli</i> has an obscene meaning in the neighboring Hoava language, and there is no memory among Hoava speakers of a neighboring language with that name. Guliguli was probably either a dialect of Kazukuru, a naive transcription of name <i>Kazukuru</i>, or even a hoax.</p><p>Arthur Capell suggested that Kazukuru was a non-Austronesian (Papuan) language, and Stephen Wurm accordingly placed all three languages in a 'Kazukuru family' within the East Papuan phylum. However, Michael Dunn and Malcolm Ross (2007) argue that the structure, phonology and lexicon of Kazukuru are strikingly similar to Oceanic languages, and that Kazukuru almost certainly was an Oceanic language, related to other New Georgia languages such as Roviana, Hoava and Ghanongga. The alleged Dororo and Guliguli wordlists are so similar to the recorded Kazukuru wordlist that they are almost certainly different transcriptions of the same language.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Linguistic purism in the English language</b> is the belief that words of native origin should be used instead of foreign-derived ones (which are mainly Latinate and Greek). "Native" can mean "Anglo-Saxon" or it can be widened to include all Germanic words. In its mildest form, it merely means using existing native words instead of foreign-derived ones (such as using <i>begin</i> instead of <i>commence</i>). In a less mild form, it also involves coining new words from Germanic roots (such as <i>wordstock</i> for <i>vocabulary</i>). In a more extreme form, it also involves reviving native words that are no longer widely used (such as <i>ettle</i> for <i>intend</i>). The resulting language is sometimes called <i><b>Anglish</b></i> (coined by the author and humorist Paul Jennings), or <i><b>Roots English</b></i> (referring to the idea that it is a "return to the roots" of English). The mild form is often advocated as part of Plain English, but the more extreme form has been and continues to be a fringe movement; the latter can also be undertaken as a form of constrained writing. </p><p>English linguistic purism is discussed by David Crystal in the <i>Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language</i>. The idea dates at least to the inkhorn term controversy of the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, writers such as Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy and William Barnes advocated linguistic purism and tried to introduce words like <i>birdlore</i> for <i>ornithology</i> and <i>bendsome</i> for <i>flexible</i>. A notable supporter in the 20th century was George Orwell, who advocated what he saw as plain Saxon words over complex Latin or Greek ones, and the idea continues to have advocates today. </p>

<p>The Estonian language has six locative cases, descended from the locative cases of Proto-Finnic. They can be classified according to a three-way contrast of entering, residing in, and exiting a state, with two sets of cases: inner and outer. Though they are not traditionally considered as such, the essive and translative cases also can be considered locative, for a system of eight (out of fourteen) cases. </p> <p>The only Estonian semantic cases not included in this system are the terminative (which even might be called locative), and the pair of abessive and comitative. </p><p>For some nouns, there are two forms of the illative: the regular suffix <i>-sse</i> (e.g. <i>keelesse</i>), added to the genitive stem, and an alternative, short form, which is either consists of a different suffix (<i>keel</i> &gt; <i>keelde</i>) lengthening (e.g. <i>maja</i> &gt; <i>majja</i>, <i>[ko:l] &gt; [ko::li]</i>), and/or other change in the word.  The always regular <i>-sse</i> illative ending is a newer innovation, and can sometimes have a slightly different meaning than the old "short form" illative, the later having the concrete locative meaning (e.g.: <i>tuppa</i> 'into the room'), and the former being used in other structures that require the illative (<i>mis puutub toasse</i> 'concerning the room...').</p>

It is based on Early Middle Japanese, the language as spoken during the Heian period (794–1185), but exhibits some later influences. Its use started to decline during the late Meiji period (1868–1912) when novelists started writing their works in the spoken form. Eventually, the spoken style came into widespread use, including in major newspapers, but many official documents were still written in the old style. After the end of World War II because of the surrender of Japan, most documents switched to the spoken style, although the classical style continues to be used in traditional genres, such as haiku and waka.

<p>Punctuation in the English language helps the reader to understand a sentence through visual means other than just the letters of the alphabet. English punctuation has always had two complementary aspects: on the one hand, phonological punctuation linked to how the sentence can be read aloud, particularly to pausing; and on the other hand, grammatical punctuation linked to the structure of the sentence. In popular discussion of language, incorrect punctuation is often seen as an indication of lack of education and of a decline of standards.</p>

It became a lingua franca and the sole language of the Jesuit mission (ICOMOS 1990:59). A Jesuit priest wrote a grammar, but no-one has been able to locate it "in recent years" (Adelaar &amp; Muysken 2004:32), and no other documentation has survived. Thus a language that was regionally important during the colonial era disappeared under pressure from more successful indigenous peoples (Adelaar 2007:326); this appears to have occurred in under half a century (Alarcón 2001:101). </p><p>Loukotka (1968) classified Gorgotoqui as a language isolate, but Kaufman (1990) left it unclassified because of a lack of data.

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>BASIC</b> (an acronym for <b>Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code</b>) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and mathematicians tended to learn. </p><p>In addition to the language itself, Kemeny and Kurtz developed the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), which allowed multiple users to edit and run BASIC programs at the same time. This general model became very popular on minicomputer systems like the PDP-11 and Data General Nova in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hewlett-Packard produced an entire computer line for this method of operation, introducing the HP2000 series in the late 1960s and continuing sales into the 1980s. Many early video games trace their history to one of these versions of BASIC. </p><p>The emergence of early microcomputers in the mid-1970s led to the development of the original Microsoft BASIC in 1975. Due to the tiny main memory available on these machines, often 4 kB, a variety of Tiny BASIC dialects were also created. BASIC was available for almost any system of the era, and naturally became the <i>de facto</i> programming language for the home computer systems that emerged in the late 1970s. These machines almost always had a BASIC installed by default, often in the machine's firmware or sometimes on a ROM cartridge. </p><p>BASIC fell from use during the later 1980s as newer machines with far greater capabilities came to market and other programming languages (such as Pascal and C) became tenable. In 1991, Microsoft released Visual Basic, combining a greatly updated version of BASIC with a visual forms builder. This reignited use of the language and "VB" remains a major programming language to this day, in the form of VB.net. </p>

Magi speakers have for a long time had close contacts and (probably extensive) integration with Austronesian speakers, with the result that there has been a significant adoption of Austronesian vocabulary (around 30–40%, particularly Magori, Gadaisu, Suau, Ouma, Yoba and Bina, of which the last three are now extinct).   </p><p>Magi itself is divided into two main groups of dialects: the eastern (Maisi/Varo) dialects, and the western (Island) dialects. </p>

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway due to Danish rule. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to controversy related to nationalism, rural versus urban, Norway's literary history, dialect versus standard language, spelling reform, and orthography.</p><p>In the United Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway (1536–1814), the official language was Danish. The urban Norwegian upper class spoke <i>"dansk-norsk"</i>, Dano-Norwegian, a form of Danish with Norwegian pronunciation and other minor local differences while the majority of the population spoke their local and regional dialects. After the two countries separated in 1814, Dano-Norwegian remained the sole official language until 1885.  </p><p>In the early 1840s, the young linguist Ivar Aasen traveled rural areas collecting examples of the words and grammar used there. He assembled a Norwegian language based on dialects little affected by Danish and published his first grammar and dictionary of the Norwegian people's language (<i>Folkespråk</i>), in 1848 and 1850 respectively. Both he and other authors wrote texts in their own dialects from around this time and in the decades following.</p><p>The Norwegian language is a North Germanic language. Dano-Norwegian evolved gradually to incorporate Norwegian forms. Aasen's people's language became established. Parliament decided in 1885 that the two forms of written Norwegian were to be equally official. Both went through some name-changes until 1929 when parliament decided that the one originally based on Danish should be called <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Bokmål</i> (literally "book language") and the one based on Norwegian dialects should be called <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Nynorsk</i> ("new Norwegian").  </p><p>In the early 20th century, a more activist approach to written Norwegian was adopted in public policy. Government attempts through several decades to bring the two language forms closer to each other with the goal of merging the two failed due to widespread resistance from both sides. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokmål and Nynorsk into one common language called <i><i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Samnorsk</i></i> through a series of reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Bokmål</i> and <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Nynorsk</i>. The unofficial form known as <i><i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Riksmål</i></i> is considered more conservative than <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Bokmål</i>. Similarly, the unofficial <i><i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Høgnorsk</i></i> is much closer to Ivar Aasen's mid-1800s language than to today's Nynorsk. Norwegians are educated in both their own language form (<i><i lang="nb" title="Bokmål language text">hovedmål</i></i> / <i><i lang="nn" title="Nynorsk language text">hovudmål</i></i>, "main language") and their secondary language form (<i><i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">sidemål</i></i>, "side language"); with the primary focus being on their own language form.  </p><p>There is no officially sanctioned spoken standard of Norwegian, but according to some, there is a de facto spoken standard of <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Bokmål</i> called Standard <i lang="no" title="Norwegian language text">Østnorsk</i> ("East Norwegian").  </p>
<p>The <b>Malayic languages</b> are a branch of the Austronesian family. They include Malay, the national language of Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia; Minangkabau in central Sumatra; and Iban in northern Borneo. </p><p>It is thought that the homeland of the Malayic languages is in western Borneo, where the Ibanic languages remain. The Malayan branch represents a secondary dispersal, probably from central Sumatra but possibly also from Borneo.</p><p>For some time there was confusion as to the placement of various languages called Dayak; it is now apparent that some of these are Malayic and some are not. The Malayic Dayak languages include Iban; the term Ibanic sometimes applies to the whole or sometimes to a smaller group of Sea Dayak peoples, or Ibanic proper. Other Dayak languages, called Land Dayak, are found in the northwest corner of Kalimantan, between Ibanic and Malayan. </p>
<p><b>Gesamtbedeutung</b> (German for "general meaning", <small>German pronunciation: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɡəˈzamtbəˌdɔʏtʊŋ]</span>), in linguistics, is the general meaning of the various uses of a morphological element. The Gesamtbedeutung of a language's past tense, for instance, might be conceived as "distance from the present". This meaning might later be generalized to refer to events both temporally distant (e.g. <i>the box was empty</i>) as well as separated in terms of reality or likelihood (e.g. <i>the box might be empty</i>, <i>if the box were empty...</i>, <i>the box could be empty</i>, etc.) </p><p>In Japanese, for example, the tense system has been  reduced to a system of "past", "non-past", and "probable", where the latter two tenses share the Gesamtbedeutung of abstraction from the real. The past tense refers to events which are complete and definite, whereas the non-past refers to virtually everything else, including present and future events. The probable tense functions in much the same way as the non-past, but with a stronger sense of separation from the present reality.  </p><p>For another example, consider the English word endings "-ing" and "-er". Both share a Gesamtbedeutung of agency (as opposed to that of patienthood, represented by such morphemes as "-ed" and "-ee"). One who is <i>driving</i> is, by definition, a <i>driver</i>. Though differing in grammatical function, these two morphemes share a common Gesamtbedeutung. </p>
<p><b>N'Ko</b> (<span dir="rtl">ߒߞߏ</span>‎) is both a script devised by Solomana Kante in 1949, as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa, and the name of the literary language written in that script. The term <i>N'Ko</i> means <i>I say</i> in all Manding languages. </p><p>The script has a few similarities to the Arabic script, notably its direction (right-to-left) and the letters which are connected at the base. Unlike Arabic, it obligatorily marks both tone and vowels. N'Ko tones are marked as diacritics, in a similar manner to the marking of some vowels in Arabic. </p>
<p>In linguistics, the <b>catena</b> (English pronunciation: <span></span>, plural <b>catenas</b> or <b>catenae</b>; from Latin for "chain") is a unit of syntax and morphology, closely associated with dependency grammars. It is a more flexible and inclusive unit than the constituent and may therefore be better suited than the constituent to serve as the fundamental unit of syntactic and morphosyntactic analysis.</p><p>The catena concept was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998 and has been seized upon by other linguists and applied to the syntax of idiosyncratic meaning of all sorts, such as ellipsis mechanisms (e.g. gapping, stripping, VP-ellipsis, pseudogapping, sluicing, answer ellipsis, comparative deletion), predicate-argument structures, and discontinuities (topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, extraposition, etc.). The catena concept has also been taken as the basis for a theory of morphosyntax, i.e. for the extension of dependencies into words; dependencies are acknowledged between the morphs that constitute words.</p><p>While the catena concept has been applied mainly to the syntax of English, other works are also demonstrating its applicability to the syntax and morphology of other languages.</p>

<p>Terentianus Maurus (a native of Mauretania), was a Latin grammarian and writer on prosody who flourished probably at the end of the third century CE. </p><p>His references to Septimius Serenus and Alphius Avitus, who belonged to the school of "new poets" (<i>poetae neoterici</i> or <i>novelli</i>) of the reign of Hadrian and later, seem to show that he was a near contemporary of those writers. He was the author of a treatise (incomplete) in four books (written chiefly in hexameters), on letters, syllables, feet and metres, of which considerable use was made by later writers on similar subjects. The most important part of it is that which deals with metres, based on the work of Caesius Bassus, the friend of Persius. </p><p>By some authorities Terentianus has been identified with the prefect of Syene mentioned in Martial (i. 86), which would make his date about a century earlier; others, again, who placed Petronius at the end of the 3rd century (a date no longer held), assigned Terentianus to the same period, from his frequent references to that author. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday</b> (often <b>M.A.K. Halliday</b>; 13 April 1925 – 15 April 2018) was an English-born linguist who developed the internationally influential <i>systemic functional linguistic</i> SFL model of language. His grammatical descriptions go by the name of <i>systemic functional grammar</i>. Halliday describes language as a semiotic system, "not in the sense of a system of signs, but a systemic resource for meaning". For Halliday, language is a "meaning potential"; by extension, he defines linguistics as the study of "how people exchange meanings by 'languaging'". Halliday describes himself as a <i>generalist</i>, meaning that he has tried "to look at language from every possible vantage point", and has described his work as "wander[ing] the highways and byways of language". But he has claimed that "to the extent that I favoured any one angle, it was the social: language as the creature and creator of human society".</p><p>Halliday's grammar differs markedly from traditional accounts that emphasise classification of individual words (e.g. noun, verb, pronoun, preposition) in formal, written sentences in a restricted number of "valued" varieties of English. Halliday's model conceives grammar explicitly as how meanings are coded into wordings, in both spoken and written modes in all varieties and formal registers of a language. Three strands of grammar operate simultaneously. They concern: (i) the interpersonal exchange between speaker and listener, and writer and reader; (ii) representation of our outer and inner worlds; and (iii) the wording of these meanings into cohesive spoken and written texts, from within the clause up to whole texts. Notably, the grammar embraces intonation in spoken language. Halliday's seminal <i>Introduction to Functional Grammar</i> (first edition, 1985) spawned a new research discipline and related pedagogical approaches. By far the most progress has been made on English, but the international growth of communities of SFL scholars has led to the adaptation of Halliday's advances to some other languages.</p>
<p>A <b>set phrase</b> or <b>fixed phrase</b> is a phrase whose parts are fixed in a certain order, even if the phrase could be changed without harming the literal meaning. This is because a set phrase is a culturally accepted phrase. A set phrase does not necessarily have any literal meaning in and of itself. Set phrases may function as idioms (e.g. <i>red herring</i>) or as words with a unique referent (e.g. <i>Red Sea</i>). There is no clear dividing line between a commonly used phrase and a set phrase. It is also not easy to draw a clear distinction between set phrases and compound words.</p><p>In theoretical linguistics, two-word set phrases are said to arise during the generative formation of English nouns.</p><p>A certain stricter notion of set phrases, more in line with the concept of a lexical item, provides an important underpinning for the formulation of meaning–text theory. </p>
<p><b>Dialect levelling</b> is the means by which dialect differences decrease. For example, in rural areas of Britain, although English is widely spoken, the pronunciation and the grammar have historically varied. During the 20th century, more people moved into towns and cities, standardising English.  Dialect levelling can develop by the influence of various types of media. </p>

A descendant of courtesans, she was also a patron of the arts and a historian. Nagarathnamma built a temple over the samadhi of the Carnatic singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru and helped establish the Tyagaraja Aradhana festival in his memory. Within a male dominated festival, she was the feminist aggressive enough to ensure that women artists were given equality to participate in it. She "was among the last practitioners of the devadasi tradition in India," and the first president of the Association of the Devadasis of Madras Presidency. She also edited and published books on poetry and anthologies. </p>

<p><b>Akatek</b> (Acateco) is a Mayan language spoken by the Akatek people primarily in the Huehuetenango Department, Guatemala in and around the municipalities of Concepción Huista, Nentón, San Miguel Acatán, San Rafael La Independencia and San Sebastián Coatán. A number of speakers also live in Chiapas, Mexico. It is a living language with 58,600 speakers in 1998, of which 48,500 lived in Guatemala and the remaining in Mexico.</p><p>Akatek is closely related to the two Mayan languages, Q'anjob'al and Jakaltek. The three languages together form the Q'anjob'al-Jakaltek sub-branch, which together with the Mocho' language form the Q'anjob'alan sub-branch, which again, together with the Chujean languages, Chuj and Tojolab'al, form the branch Q'anjobalan–Chujean. It is believed that Q'anjob'al–Jakaltek split into Akatek, Q'anjob'al and Jakaltek some 500 to 1,500 years ago.</p><p>Akatek was regarded as a dialect of the Q'anjob'al language until the 1970s, when linguists realized that it has a distinct grammar from that of Q'anjob'al. That it has been thought a dialect of Q'anjob'al is reflected in the many names Akatek has had through time. One of its primary names before it was named Akatek was <i>Western Q'anjob'al</i>, but it has also been called <i>Conob</i> and various names including <i>Q'anjob'al</i> and the municipality where it is spoken. </p><p>An interesting aspect of Akatek grammar, which is also present in most other Q'anjobalan languages, is the use of directional morphemes, which appear as enclitics. These morphemes make it possible for the speaker to talk about movement and direction in space without pointing or using other gestures. Consider the stative verb <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔej]</span> <i>to be</i>, which can appear as <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔejʔok]</span> <i>existing inwards</i>, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔejtok]</span> <i>existing towards there, away from the speaker and listener</i> and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʔeːltox]</span> <i>existing from the inside out</i>, using different enclitics. </p>

It originated circa 1990 at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley, developed by an international team led by Steve Omohundro. It supports garbage collection and generics by subtypes. </p><p>Originally, it was based on Eiffel, but it has diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. It is probably best to view it as an object-oriented language, with many ideas borrowed from Eiffel. </p><p>Even the name is inspired by Eiffel; the Sather Tower is a recognizable landmark at Berkeley, named after Jane Krom Sather, the widow of Peder Sather, who donated large sums to the foundation of the university. </p><p>Sather also takes inspiration from other programming languages and paradigms: iterators, design by contract, abstract classes, multiple inheritance, anonymous functions, operator overloading, contravariant type system. </p><p>The original Berkeley implementation (last stable version 1.1 was released in 1995, no longer maintained) has been adopted by the Free Software Foundation therefore becoming GNU Sather. Last stable GNU version (1.2.3) was released in July 2007 and the software is currently not maintained. There were several other variants: Sather-K from the University of Karlsruhe; Sather-W from the University of Waikato (implementation of Sather version 1.3); Peter Naulls' port of ICSI Sather 1.1 to RISC OS; and pSather, a parallel version of ICSI Sather addressing non-uniform memory access multiprocessor architectures but presenting a shared memory model to the programmer. </p><p>The former ICSI Sather compiler (now GNU Sather) is implemented as a compiler to C, i.e., the compiler does not output object or machine code, but takes Sather source code and generates C source code as an intermediate language. Optimizing is left to the C compiler. </p><p>The GNU Sather compiler, written in Sather itself, is dual licensed under the GNU GPL &amp; LGPL. </p>
<p><b>Middle Burmese</b> was a form of the Burmese language spoken from the 16th century to the 18th century. Its beginning roughly corresponds with the rise of the Taungoo Dynasty and its transition to Modern Burmese with the beginning of the Konbaung Dynasty. Its transition to Modern Burmese occurred in the 18th century. Middle Burmese is characterized by stabilization of Burmese orthography and steady evolution of the Burmese phonology, which accelerated during the transition from Middle Burmese to Modern Burmese.</p><p>The transition from Old Burmese to Middle Burmese included phonological changes (e.g., mergers of sound pairs that were distinct in Old Burmese) as well as accompanying changes in the underlying orthography.</p><p>The transition between Middle Burmese and Modern Burmese was dominated by substantial changes in pronunciation, more so than that between Old Burmese and Middle Burmese. However, many features of Middle Burmese have been preserved in the literary tradition (high register) of written Modern Burmese, including grammatical markers and lexical particles. Word order, grammatical structure and vocabulary have remained markedly comparable, well into Modern Burmese, with the exception of lexical content (e.g., function words).</p>

<p><b>Lapine</b> is a fictional language created by author Richard Adams for his 1972 novel <i>Watership Down</i>, where it is spoken by rabbit characters. The language was again used in Adams' 1996 sequel, <i>Tales from Watership Down</i>, and has appeared in both the film and television adaptations. The fragments of language presented by Adams consist of a few dozen distinct words, and are chiefly used for the naming of rabbits, their mythological characters, and objects in their world. The name "Lapine" comes from the French word for rabbit, <i>lapin</i>, and can also be used to describe rabbit society.</p>

<p>The <b>Samaritan alphabet</b> is used by the Samaritans for religious writings, including the Samaritan Pentateuch, writings in Samaritan Hebrew, and for commentaries and translations in Samaritan Aramaic and occasionally Arabic. </p> <p>Samaritan is a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which was a variety of the Phoenician alphabet in which large parts of the Hebrew Bible were originally penned. All these scripts are believed to be descendants of the Proto-Sinaitic script. That script was used by the ancient Israelites, both Jews and Samaritans. The better-known "square script" Hebrew alphabet traditionally used by Jews is a stylized version of the Aramaic alphabet called "Assyrian writing" (כתב אשורי) which they adopted from the Persian Empire (which in turn adopted it from the Arameans). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the Tetragrammaton, but soon that custom was also abandoned. </p><p>The Samaritan alphabet first became known to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1631 by Jean Morin. In 1616 the traveler Pietro della Valle had purchased a copy of the text in Damascus, and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p>In mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a <b>formal language</b> is a set of strings of symbols together with a set of rules that are specific to it. </p><p>The alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from which the strings of the language may be formed. The strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called <i>well-formed words</i> or <i>well-formed formulas</i>. A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also called its formation rule. </p><p>The field of <b>formal language theory</b> studies primarily the purely syntactical aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages. In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics. In computational complexity theory, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power. In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems, and mathematical formalism is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>   <p><b>French Flemish</b> (French Flemish: <i>Fransch vlaemsch</i>, Standard Dutch: <i>Frans-Vlaams</i>, French: <i lang="fr">flamand français</i>) is a West Flemish dialect spoken in the north of contemporary France. Place names attest to Flemish having been spoken since the 8th century in the area that was ceded to France in the 17th century and which became known as French Flanders. Its dialect subgroup, called French Flemish, meanwhile, became a minority dialect that survives mainly in Dunkirk (<i>Duinkerke</i> in Dutch/<i>Duunkerke</i> in West Flemish = dune church), Bourbourg (<i>Broekburg</i> in Dutch), Calais (<i>Kales</i>), Saint-Omer (<i>Sint-Omaars</i>) with an ethnic enclave Haut-Pont (<i>Haute-Ponte</i>) known for its predominantly Flemish community and Bailleul (<i>Belle</i>). French-Flemish has about 20,000 daily users, and twice that number of occasional speakers. The language's status appears to be moribund, but there has been an active movement to retain French Flemish in the region.</p>
<p>In linguistics, <b>grammatical mood</b> (also <b>mode</b>) is a grammatical feature of verbs, used for signaling modality. That is, it is the use of verbal inflections that allow speakers to express their attitude toward what they are saying (e.g. a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). The term is also used more broadly to describe the syntactic expression of modality, that is, the use of verb phrases that do not involve inflexion of the verb itself. </p><p>Mood is distinct from grammatical tense or grammatical aspect, although the same word patterns are used for expressing more than one of these meanings at the same time in many languages, including English and most other modern Indo-European languages. (See tense–aspect–mood for a discussion of this.) </p><p>Some examples of moods are indicative, interrogative, imperative, subjunctive, injunctive, optative, and potential. These are all finite forms of the verb. Infinitives, gerunds, and participles, which are non-finite forms of the verb, are not considered to be examples of moods. </p><p>Some Uralic Samoyedic languages have more than ten moods; Nenets has as many as sixteen. The original Indo-European inventory of moods consisted of indicative, subjunctive, optative, and imperative. Not every Indo-European language has all of these moods, but the most conservative ones such as Avestan, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit have them all. English has indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; other moods, such as the conditional, do not appear as morphologically distinct forms. </p><p>Not all of the moods listed below are clearly conceptually distinct.  Individual terminology varies from language to language, and the coverage of (e.g.) the "conditional" mood in one language may largely overlap with that of the "hypothetical" or "potential" mood in another. Even when two different moods exist in the same language, their respective usages may blur, or may be defined by syntactic rather than semantic criteria. For example, the subjunctive and optative moods in Ancient Greek alternate syntactically in many subordinate clauses, depending on the tense of the main verb. The usage of the indicative, subjunctive, and jussive moods in Classical Arabic is almost completely controlled by syntactic context. The only possible alternation in the same context is between indicative and jussive following the negative particle <i>lā</i>. </p>

It was composed of eighteen 20-day "months," called <i lang="es" title="Spanish language text">veintenas</i> or <i lang="nci" title="Classical Nahuatl language text">mētztli</i> (the contemporary Nahuatl word for month) with a separate 5-day period at the end of the year called the <i lang="nci" title="Classical Nahuatl language text">nemontemi</i>. Whatever name that was used for these periods in pre-Columbian times is unknown. Through Spanish usage, the 20-day period of the Aztec calendar has become commonly known as a <i lang="es" title="Spanish language text">veintena</i>. The Aztec word for moon is <i lang="nci">mētztli</i>, and this word is today to describe these 20-day periods, although as the sixteenth-century missionary and early ethnographer, Diego Durán explained: </p> <blockquote><p>In ancient times the year was composed of eighteen months, and thus it was observed by these Indian people.  Since their months were made of no more than twenty days, these were all the days contained in a month, because they were not guided by the moon but by the days; therefore, the year had eighteen months.  The days of the year were counted twenty by twenty.</p></blockquote> <p>The <i lang="nci" title="Classical Nahuatl language text">xiuhpōhualli</i> calendar, also known as the "vague year," had its antecedents in form and function in earlier Mesoamerican calendars, and the 365-day count has a long history of use throughout the region.

The first year of the Aztec calendar round was called 2 Acatl and the last 1 Tochtli. The solar calendar was connected to agricultural practices and held an important place in Aztec religion, with each month being associated with its own particular religious and agricultural festivals. Each 20-day period started on a <i>Cipactli</i> (Crocodile) day of the <i lang="nci" title="Classical Nahuatl language text">tonalpōhualli</i> for which a festival was held.

<p><b>Paranilotic</b> is a group of languages proposed by Carl Meinhof. Karl Lepsius had established the Nilotic languages as a family, with Western, Eastern, and Southern branches. Meinhof proposed that only Western were truly Nilotic, and that Eastern and Southern, which he called <b>Nilo-Hamitic</b>, were a mixture of (Western) Nilotic and Hamitic languages (in particular, modern Cushitic), based on racial and other non-linguistic considerations. Joseph Greenberg reverted to Lepsius's classification, as part of an attempt to remove racial classifications from African linguistics. However, Tucker and Bryan's (1956, 1966) influential surveys resurrected Meinhof's proposal under the name <i>Paranilotic</i>, and that name is still sometimes found, especially in non-linguistic works. Modern linguistics has discarded the concept of Paranilotic, seeing Nilotic more or less as Lepsius had, with three distinct branches.</p>

<p><b>Trisyllabic laxing</b>, or <b>trisyllabic shortening</b>, is any of three processes in English in which tense vowels (long vowels or diphthongs) become lax (short monophthongs) if they are followed by two syllables, the first of which syllable is unstressed: </p> <ol><li>The earliest occurrence of trisyllabic laxing occurred in late Old English and caused stressed long vowels to become shortened before clusters of two consonants when two or more syllables followed.</li> <li>Later in Middle English, the process was expanded to all vowels when two or more syllables followed.</li> <li>The Middle English sound change remained in the language and is still a mostly-productive process in Modern English, detailed in Chomsky and Halle's <i>The Sound Pattern of English</i>.</li></ol><p>The Middle English sound change occurred before the Great Vowel Shift and other changes to the nature of vowels. As a result of the changes, the pairs of vowels related by trisyllabic laxing often bear little resemblance to one another in Modern English; however, originally they always bore a consistent relationship. For example, tense <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/aʊ/</span> was <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[uː]</span>, and lax <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ʌ/</span> was <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[u]</span> at the time of trisyllabic laxing. </p><p>In some cases, trisyllabic laxing appears to take place when it should not have done so: for example, in "south" vs. "southern". In such cases, the apparent anomaly is caused by later sound changes: "southern" was pronounced <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[suːðernə]</span> when trisyllabic laxing applied. </p><p>In the modern language, there are systematic exceptions to the process, such as in words ending in <i>-ness</i>: "mindfulness, loneliness".

<p><b>Raimon Vidal de Bezaudu(n)</b> (Catalan: <i>Ramon Vidal de Besalú</i>) (flourished early 13th century) was a Catalan troubadour from Besalù. He is notable for authoring the first tract in a Romance language (Occitan) on the subject of grammar and poetry, the <i>Razós de trobar</i> (c. 1210), a title which translates as "Reasons (or Guidelines) of troubadour composition". He began his career as a joglar and he spent his formative years at the court of Hug de Mataplana, which he often recalls fondly in his poems and songs. </p><p>In the <i>Razós</i>, Raimon distinguishes the "parladura francesa" (French) from the "cella de Lemosin" (Occitan). He also discusses the art of the listener (<i>li auzidor</i>) and his responsibility to understand the troubadour works. Raimon's insistence that the audience understand what is sung and that they keep silent during its singing has been regarded as seminal in the history of classical music. To him, listeners have a responsibility to enquire about what they do not understand (which is "one of the wisest things in the world") and to be true to the quality of the work, praising greatness and condemning poor form. Vidal also took pains to argue for the superiority of <i>lemosí</i> (or <i>Lemozi</i>, i.e., Occitan) over other vernaculars, prompting the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri to write a <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> justifying the use of the Tuscan vernacular as opposed to the Occitan. The <i>Razós</i> ends with an Occitan-Italian glossary. Late in the 13th century, Terramagnino of Pisa wrote a condensed verse form of the <i>Razós</i>. Jofre de Foixà wrote an expanded version, the <i>Regles de trobar</i>, for James II of Sicily. </p><p>In addition to the aforementioned tract, there are preserved several fragments of song lyrics and three narrative <i>romans</i>. Among his most famous is <i>So fo e·l temps qu'om era gais</i>, which is fawning in its treatment of Raimon de Miraval, an earlier troubadour. In the <i>nova</i>, Raimon presents two ladies as fighting over one knight.  The <i>nova</i> or <i>ensenhamen</i> called <i>Abril issi'e mays intrava</i>, which also refers to Miraval (and to the three sons of Henry II of England: <i>Enricx</i>, <i>Richartz</i>, and <i>Jofrés</i>), is an assessment of contemporary literature and one of the best descriptions of the joglar that we possess. Finally, the <i>Castiagilós</i> is much like a fable, which narrates the story of a jealous husband who is eventually convinced that his suspicions are baseless. </p><p>Vidal wrote at the height of the troubadours' popularity and as he himself said: </p> <blockquote> <p>"all people wish to listen to troubadour songs and to compose (<i>trobar</i>) them, including Christians, Saracens, Jews, emperors, princes, kings, dukes, counts, viscounts, vavassours, knights, clerics, townsmen, and villeins."<br><i>Tota gens Crestiana, Juzeus e Sarazís, emperador, princeps, rei, duc, conte, vesconte, contor, valvasor e tuit autre cavailler e clergues borgés e vilanz.</i> </p> </blockquote>

<p><b>Digital dictation</b> is a method of recording and editing the spoken word in real-time. The recording is done by the use of a digital recorder. Digital recorders are lighter, have a longer battery life and are able to record for a lot longer utilizing the same media, as compared to analog tape based dictation machines. The files generated with digital recorders vary in size, depending on the manufacturer and the format the user chooses. The most common file formats that digital recorders generate have one of the extensions WAV, WMA or MP3. True dictation machines record in the DSS and DS2 format. </p><p>The DSS and DS2 file formats compress audio allowing for greater portability. In some cases, speech is recorded where sound quality is paramount and transcription unnecessary, e.g. for broadcasting a theatre play; such recording uses techniques closer to high-fidelity music recording, rather than those discussed here. </p><p>Digital dictation offers several advantages over traditional cassette tape based dictation: </p> <ul><li>The user can instantly rewind or fast forward to any point within the dictation file to review or edit.</li> <li>The random access ability of digital audio allows inserting audio at any point without overwriting the following text.</li> <li>Dictation produces a file which can be transferred electronically, e.g. via WAN, LAN, USB, e-mail, telephony, BlackBerry, FTP, etc.</li> <li>Large dictation files can be shared with multiple typists.</li> <li>Sound may be CD quality and can improve transcription accuracy and speed.</li> <li>Digital dictation provides the ability to report on the volume or type of dictation and transcription outstanding or completed within an organization.</li></ul><p>Dictation audio can be recorded in various audio file formats. Most digital dictation systems use a lossy form of audio compression based on modelling of the vocal tract to minimize hard disk space and optimize network utilization as files are transferred between users. (Note that WAV is not an audio encoding format, but a file format and has little or no bearing on the encoding rate (kbit/s), size or audio quality of the resulting file.) </p><p>Digital dictation is different from speech recognition where audio is analyzed by a computer using speech algorithms in an attempt to transcribe the document. With digital dictation the process of converting digital audio to text may be done using digital transcription software, typically controlled by a foot switch which allows the transcriber to PLAY, STOP, REWIND, and BACKSPACE. </p><p>These days there are Digital Transcription Kits that allow integration with Speech Recognition Software. This gives the typist the option to either type a document manually, or send a document to be converted to text by Software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking. </p>

It is the official and literary standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of the European Union. Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a recognized minority language in Serbia, and neighboring countries. </p><p>Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, Shtokavian, more specifically on Eastern Herzegovinian, which is also the basis of Standard Serbian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin. In the mid-18th century, the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional <i>lingua franca</i> pushing back regional Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian vernaculars. The decisive role was played by Croatian Vukovians, who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, in addition to designing a phonological orthography. Croatian is written in Gaj's Latin alphabet.</p><p>Besides the Shtokavian dialect, on which Standard Croatian is based, there are two other main dialects spoken on the territory of Croatia, Chakavian and Kajkavian. These dialects, and the four national standards, are usually subsumed under the term "Serbo-Croatian" in English, though this term is controversial for native speakers, and paraphrases such as "Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian" are therefore sometimes used instead, especially in diplomatic circles. </p>   
<p>  In addition to its classical and literary form, Malay had various regional dialects established before the rise of the Malaccan Sultanate. Also, Malay spread through interethnic contact and trade across the Malay archipelago as far as the Philippines. That contact resulted in a lingua franca that was called <i>Bazaar Malay</i> or <i>low Malay</i> and in Malay <i>Melayu Pasar</i>. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin, influenced by contact among Malay, Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch traders. </p><p>Besides the general simplification that occurs with pidgins, the Malay lingua franca had several distinctive characteristics. One was that possessives were formed with <i>punya</i> 'its owner'; another was that plural pronouns were formed with <i>orang</i> 'person'. The only Malayic affixes that remained productive were <i>tər-</i> and <i>bər-</i>. </p><p>Other features: </p> <ul><li><i>Ada</i> became a progressive particle.</li> <li>Reduced forms of <i>ini</i> 'this' and <i>itu</i> 'that' before a noun became determiners.</li> <li>The verb <i>pərgi</i> 'go' was reduced, and became a preposition 'towards'.</li> <li>Causative constructions were formed with <i>kasi</i> or <i>bəri</i> 'to give' or <i>bikin</i> or <i>buat</i> 'to make'.</li> <li>A single preposition, often <i>sama</i>, was used for multiple functions, including direct and indirect object.</li></ul><p>For example,</p> <ul><li><i>Rumah-ku</i> 'my house' becomes <i>Saya punya rumah</i></li> <li><i>Saya pukul dia</i> 'I hit him' becomes <i>Saya kasi pukul dia</i></li> <li><i>Megat dipukul Robert</i> 'Megat is hit by Robert' becomes <i>Megat dipukul dek Robert</i></li></ul><p>Bazaar Malay is still used to a limited extent in Singapore and Malaysia.

It is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism; the predominant language of most works of Hindu philosophy as well as some of the principal texts of Buddhism and Jainism. Sanskrit, in its various variants and dialects, was the <i>lingua franca</i> of ancient and medieval India. In the early 1st millennium CE, along with Buddhism and Hinduism, Sanskrit migrated to Southeast Asia, parts of East Asia and Central Asia, emerging as a language of high culture and of local ruling elites in these regions.</p><p>Sanskrit is an Old Indo-Aryan language. As one of the oldest documented members of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. It is related to Greek and Latin, as well as Hittite, Luwian, Old Avestan and many other extinct languages with historical significance to Europe, West Asia and Central Asia. It traces its linguistic ancestry to the Proto-Indo-Aryan language, Proto-Indo-Iranian and the Proto-Indo-European languages.</p><p>Sanskrit is traceable to the 2nd millennium BCE in a form known as the Vedic Sanskrit, with the <i>Rigveda</i> as the earliest surviving text. A more refined and an exact grammatical form called the Classical Sanskrit emerged in mid-1st millennium BCE with the <i>Aṣṭādhyāyī</i> treatise of Pāṇini. Sanskrit, though not necessarily Classical Sanskrit, is the root language of many Prakrit languages. Examples include numerous modern daughter Northern Indian subcontinental languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Punjabi and Nepali.</p><p>The body of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of philosophical and religious texts, as well as poetry, music, drama, scientific, technical and other texts. In the ancient era, Sanskrit compositions were orally transmitted by methods of memorisation of exceptional complexity, rigour and fidelity. The earliest known inscriptions in Sanskrit are from the 1st-century BCE, such as the few discovered in Ayodhya and Ghosundi-Hathibada (Chittorgarh). Sanskrit texts dated to the 1st millennium CE were written in the Brahmi script, the Nāgarī script, the historic South Indian scripts and their derivative scripts. Sanskrit is one of the 22 languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. It continues to be widely used as a ceremonial and ritual language in Hinduism and some Buddhist practices such as hymns and chants. </p>

<p>Irish, like all modern Celtic languages, is characterized by its initial consonant mutations.  These mutations affect the initial consonant of a word under specific morphological and syntactic conditions. The mutations are an important tool in understanding the relationship between two words and can differentiate various meanings. </p><p>Irish, like Manx and colloquial Scottish Gaelic, uses two mutations on consonants: <b>lenition</b> (Irish: <i lang="ga">séimhiú</i> [ˈʃeː.vʲuː]) and <b>eclipsis</b> (<i lang="ga" title="Irish language text">urú</i> [ˈʊ.ɾˠuː]) (the alternative names, <i>aspiration</i> for lenition and <i>nasalisation</i> for eclipsis, are also used, but those terms are a bit misleading). </p><p>Originally these mutations were phonologically governed external sandhi effects: lenition was caused by a consonant being between two vowels, and eclipsis when a nasal preceded an obstruent, including at the beginning of a word. </p><p>There are also two mutations, <b>t-prothesis</b> and <b>h-prothesis</b>, found on vowel-initial words. </p><p>See Irish phonology for a discussion of the symbols used on this page. </p>
<p><b>Glossematics</b> is a structuralist linguistic methodology of the twentieth century proposed by Louis Hjelmslev. It defines the <i>glosseme</i> as the most basic unit or component of language. The glosseme is defined as the smallest irreducible unit of both the content and expression planes of language; in the expression plane, the glosseme is said to be identical or nearly identical to the phoneme, whereas it is stressed that traditional analyses have not adequately revealed the basic units of the content plane of languages. </p><p>The term was coined by Louis Hjelmslev and Hans Jørgen Uldall. The term <i>glosseme</i> derives from the Greek word <i>glossa</i> (meaning here "language") and the <i>-eme</i> suffix; it was also used by Leonard Bloomfield in describing his system of basic linguistic units (see Tagmeme). The ultimate goal of the linguist who studies glossemes is the same as that of a physicist who studies atoms, to with a more perfect understanding of the whole through a thorough study of the structure of the constituent parts. To the greatest extent possible, glossematics seeks to show a <i>tabula rasa</i> approach, constructing an internally consistent framework of axioms and principles with minimal reliance on external terms. It is an abstracting form of structuralism, concerned with how "functives" describe relationships among "terminals" rather than with words themselves. This system, constructed without recourse to any particular language or constructivist modality, seeks to establish a universal standard defining the necessary and sufficient conditions of language. </p>

<p><b>Apurinã</b>, or <b>Ipurina</b>, is a Southern Maipurean language spoken by the Apurinã people of the Amazon basin. It has an active–stative syntax. Apurinã is a Portuguese word used to describe the Popikariwakori people and their language (Facundes 34, 2000). Apurinã indigenous communities are predominantly found along the Purus River, in the Northwestern Amazon region in Brazil, in the Amazonas state (Pickering 2, 2009). Its population is currently spread over twenty-seven different indigenous lands along the Purus River (Apurinã PIB). with an estimated total population of 9,500 people. It is predicted, however, that fewer than 30% of the Apurinã population can speak the language fluently (Facundes 35, 2000). A definite number of speakers cannot be firmly determined because of the regional scattered presence of its people. The spread of Apurinã speakers to different regions was initially caused by conflict or disease, which has consequently led natives to lose the ability to speak the language for lack of practice and also because of interactions with other communities. </p><p>Also, as a consequence of violence and oppression towards indigenous people, some natives and descendants choose to not identify themselves as indigenous, further reducing the number of people categorized as speaking the language (Facundes 23, 2000). The low transmission and cultivation of the language result I  the risk of endangerment. The endangerment level of Apurinã is currently at level 3 (Facundes 4, 2000), which means that although adults still speak the language, children are no longer being exposed to it. Because they are taught Portuguese or Spanish instead, a further reduction in the number of people that speak the language could occur over the years, eventually leading it to become extinct. </p>

<p><b>Ka'apor Sign Language</b> (also known as <b>Urubu Sign Language</b> or <b>Urubu–Ka'apor Sign Language</b>, although these are pejorative) was a village sign language used by the small community of Ka'apor people in the Brazilian state of Maranhão. Linguist Jim Kakumasu observed in 1968 that the number of deaf people in the community was 7 out of a population of about 500. This relatively high ratio of deafness (1 in 75) led to both hearing and deaf members of the community using the language, and most hearing children grow up bilingual in the spoken and signed languages. The current state of the language is unknown. Other Indigenous tribes in the region have also been reported to use sign languages, and to communicate between themselves using sign language pidgins.</p><p>Notable features of Ka'apor Sign Language are its object–subject–verb word order, and its locating of the past in front of the signer and the future behind, in contrast to sign languages of European origin, including American Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. This may represent a world view of the past as something visible, and the future as unknowable.</p><p>Kakumasu noted several features which sign language linguists today recognise as common to other sign languages, such as the use of name signs. Conditional and imperative grammatical moods are marked by non-manual features such as a widening of the eyes and tensing of facial muscles. Questions are marked with a question sign either before or after the clause, described as "a motion of the index finger towards the referent (addressee) with a slight wrist twist." </p>
<p><b>Boko</b> (or bookoo) is a Latin-script alphabet used to write  the Hausa language. The first boko was devised by Europeans in the early 19th century, and developed in the early 20th century by the British (mostly) and French colonial authorities. It was made the official Hausa alphabet in 1930. Since the 1950s boko has been the main alphabet for Hausa. Arabic script (<i>ajami</i>) is now only used in Islamic schools and for Islamic literature. Since the 1980s, Nigerian boko has been based on the Pan-Nigerian alphabet. </p><p>The word <i>boko</i> also refers to non-Islamic (usually western) education ('yan boko = "modern school") or secularism.  The word is commonly stated to be a borrowing from English <i>book</i>. In 2013, leading Hausa expert Paul Newman published "The Etymology of Hausa boko", in which he presents the view that boko is in fact a native word meaning "sham, fraud", Western learning and writing being seen as deceitful in comparison to traditional Koranic scholarship.</p> <p>There are some differences in boko used in Niger and Nigeria due to different pronunciations in the French and English languages. The letter ⟨ƴ⟩ is used only in Niger; in Nigeria it is written ⟨ʼy⟩. </p><p>Tone, vowel length, and the distinction between <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/r/</span> and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɽ/</span> (which does not exist for all speakers) are not marked in writing. So, for example, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/daɡa/</span> "from" and <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/daːɡaː/</span> "battle" are both written <i>daga</i>. </p>

<p><b>Kurt Heinrich Sethe</b> (30 September 1869 – 6 July 1934) was a noted German Egyptologist and philologist from Berlin. He was a student of Adolf Erman. Sethe collected numerous texts from Egypt during his visits there and edited the <i>Urkunden des ægyptischen Altertums</i> which is a standard catalogue of Ancient Egyptian literature and text. </p><p>Among Sethe's many contributions to Egyptology, two are singled out by Gardiner (p. 433): "...the pronunciation of Middle Egyptian... The chief authorities to be consulted are Sethe's great work on the Egyptian verb, and a much later brilliant article entitled <i>Die Vokalisation des Ägyptischen</i> in <i>Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft</i>"" (1923). Actually, Sethe was the first one to put forth a systematic theory of the Egyptian verb; it was no easy accomplishment, since the inflection of the Egyptian verb was done mainly by changing the vowels, and the Egyptians only wrote consonants. </p><p>Among Sethe's students were Hans Jakob Polotsky and Alan Gardiner. Sethe's anthology, <i>Aegyptische Lesestuecke,</i> is still doing sterling service to the beginners in the study of the language. Sethe also published a comprehensive collection of Egyptian epigraphy, which he called <i>Urkunden der Aegyptologie.</i> </p>

<p><b>Stockholm dialects</b> are the forms of Swedish spoken in Stockholm. An exact definition encompassing its peculiarities is hard to find, as a cosmopolitan culture and early adoption infers a great variety of international influences that are then spread to the rest of Sweden, and, as Stockholm is a highly urbanized area, the dialects of Stockholm are more likely to undergo rapid changes than dialects spoken in rural areas. </p><p>Some word endings are typical of Stockholm dialects. When windmills were used they were given female names ending in <i>-an</i>. For instance a windmill owned by a Dutchman (<i>holländare</i>) would be called <i>Holländskan</i> ("Dutchwoman"). The <i>-an</i> ending was later adopted for other places. For instance, Kungsträdgården became <i>Kungsan</i> and <i>bibliotek</i> ("library") became <i>bibblan</i>. Another ending is <i>-is</i> from Latin although in practice it is used roughly as a diminutive or to add familiarity. Examples include <i>Medis</i> (Medborgarplatsen) or <i>Rålis</i> (Rålambshovsparken). Some of these words, such as <i>dagis</i> for <i>daghem</i> ("pre-school"), have spread into colloquial Swedish in general. </p>
<p><b>Small Seal Script</b> (Chinese: <span lang="zh" title="Chinese language text">小篆</span>, <i>xiǎozhuàn</i>), formerly romanized as <b>Hsiao-chuan</b> and also known as <b>Seal Script</b>, <b>Lesser Seal Script</b> and <b>Qin Script</b> (<span lang="zh" title="Chinese language text">秦篆</span>, <i>Qínzhuàn</i>), is an archaic form of Chinese calligraphy. It was standardized and promulgated as a national standard by Li Si, prime minister under Shi Huangdi, the First Emperor of Qin. </p><p>Before the Qin conquest of the six other major warring states of Zhou China, local styles of characters had evolved independently of one another for centuries, producing what are called the "Scripts of the Six States" (<span lang="zh" title="Chinese language text">六國文字</span>), all of which are included under the general term "Great Seal Script". Under one unified government, however, the diversity was deemed undesirable as it hindered timely communication, trade, taxation, and transportation, and as independent scripts might be used to represent dissenting political ideas. </p><p>Hence, Emperor Qin Shi Huang mandated the systematic unification of weights, measures, currencies, etc., and the use of a standard writing script. Characters which were different from those found in Qin were discarded, and the Qin's small seal characters became the standard for all regions within the empire. This policy came in about 220 BC, the year after Qin's unification of the Chinese states.</p><p>The standardized use of small seal characters was promulgated via the Cangjiepian, a primer compiled by Li Si and two other ministers. This compilation, stated to contain 3,300 characters, is no longer extant, and is known only through Chinese commentaries through the centuries. Several hundred characters from fragmented commentaries were collected during the Qing period, and recent archeological excavations in Anhui, China, have uncovered several hundred more on bamboo strips, showing the order of the characters; however, the script found is not the small seal script, as the discovery dates from Han times. </p>
<p><b>Jersey Legal French</b>, also known as <b>Jersey French</b> (French: <i lang="fr">français de jersey</i>), was the official dialect of French used administratively in Jersey. Since the anglicisation of the island, it survives as a written language for some laws, contracts, and other documents. Jersey's parliament, the States of Jersey, is part of the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie. The use of the English language has been allowed in legislative debates since 2 February 1900; the current use of French in the States of Jersey is generally restricted to certain limited official state functions and formalities (prayers, ceremonies, formulæ). </p><p>By common custom and usage, the sole official language of Jersey in present times is the English language. </p><p>Jersey Legal French is not to be confused with Jèrriais, a variety of the Norman language also called Jersey Norman-French, spoken on the island. </p><p>The French of Jersey differs little from that of France. It is characterised by several terms particular to Jersey administration and a few expressions imported from Norman. </p>

<p><b>Bangkok Malay</b> also referred as <b>Bangkok Melayu</b> or <b>Nayu</b> is the local variant of Malay spoken by ethnic Malays living in Bangkok and its surrounding areas. It arose after the intermingling of Malay community from Southern Thailand and slowly diverge as a distinct variety of Malay. Despite historical Malay presence in what is now Bangkok dated as early as Ayutthaya era, nonetheless the dialect only began to develop after the settlement of deportees from Kedah, Kelantan, Pattani, Satun and Yaring dating from 1786. </p><p>The speakers of Bangkok Malay can be found throughout the city, with higher concentration in Malay enclaves in Thon Buri, Thung Khru, Phra Pradaeng, Bang Kho Laem, Phra Khanong, Khlong Saen Saep, Min Buri, Nong Chok, Bang Nam Priao, Chachoengsao, Thon Buri and Pom Prap Sattru Phai.</p><p>There are several variations of the dialect, owing to various waves and origin of Malay settlement in the city. The dialect was largely based on Pattani Malay with visible divergent from the original spoken in the south, this allowed Bangkok Malay to constitute as a separate dialect from Pattani Malay. Another notable sub-dialect of Bangkok Malay spoken in Bang Bua Thong and Tha It districts demonstrating a strong Kedahan influence, this correlates to the fact that most Malay people from these areas are the descendant of deportees that were bought from a village in western Yala in the 18th century, who spoke with a Kedahan dialect.</p><p>Following the rise of urbanism and the assimilation with the larger Thai majority, the language is now highly confined with adult over the age of 40 with varied fluency among younger generations. </p>

<p><b>Semantic discord</b> is the situation where two parties disagree on the definition of a word or several words essential to communicating or formulating any concept at issue.  The two parties basically understand two different meanings for the word, or they associate the word with different concepts. Consequently, their disagreeing on these definitions explains why there is a dispute at all. Semantic discord most often arises due to differences in the cultural backgrounds or professional fields of the communicators.  Any word or instance of communication that has its effectiveness reduced due to semantic discord is said to be <i>semantically loaded</i>.  Semantic disputes are arguments that arise over terms due to semantic discord. </p>
<p><i><b>Zagranitsa</b></i> (Russian: <span lang="ru" title="Russian language text">заграница</span>, <small>IPA: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[zəɡrɐˈnʲit͡sə]</span>; <abbr title="literal translation">lit.</abbr> "across the border" or "abroad") refers to the real and imagined borders of an idealized, imaginary West that lay beyond the borders of the Soviet Union during the late Soviet period. The concept of <i>zagranitsa</i> influenced Soviet life and culture from the 1950s until the 1980s. It manifested itself in a widespread fascination with Western manufactured goods, films, music, fashion and ideas. </p><p>Alexei Yurchak, in his 2006 book <i>Everything Was Forever, Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation</i>, describes <i>zagranitsa</i> as an "imaginary elsewhere" that was "simultaneously knowable and unattainable, tangible and abstract, mundane and exotic". The idea of <i>zagranitsa</i> as utopia, at once an aspiration, a negation, and a reflection of the Soviet Union itself, became embedded into Soviet culture and identity. </p><p>Once travel to the United States became more accessible with Perestroika, the "imaginary West" lost its mythical connotations, resulting in disappointment and disillusionment. As Svetlana Boym writes of the 1985 hit song "The Last Letter" (also known as "Goodbye Amerika") by Russian rock group Nautilus Pompilius, bidding farewell to America— that is, "the beloved Amerika of Soviet underground culture… the mythical West of the Russian imagination"—was as painful as bidding farewell to Soviet culture itself and the "utopian fantasy land of one's youth".</p>

<p>The <b>Bilingual Education Act (BEA)</b> (81 Stat. 816), also known as <b>Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967</b> (Pub.L. 90–247), approved by the 90th United States Congress on January 2, 1968, and was the first United States federal legislation recognized the needs of limited English speaking ability (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator Ralph Yarborough and was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local school districts around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of elementary and secondary school students not fluent in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in U.S. public education. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability.</p>

<p><i><b>Verbal Behavior</b></i> is a 1957 book by psychologist B. F. Skinner, in which he inspects human behavior, describing what is traditionally called linguistics. The book <i>Verbal Behavior</i> is almost entirely theoretical, involving little experimental research in the work itself. It was an outgrowth of a series of lectures first presented at the University of Minnesota in the early 1940s and developed further in his summer lectures at Columbia and William James lectures at Harvard in the decade before the book's publication. A growing body of research and applications based on <i>Verbal Behavior</i> has occurred since its original publication, particularly in the past decade.</p><p>In addition, a growing body of research has developed on structural topics in verbal behavior such as grammar.</p>

<p>In linguistics, a <b>VO language</b> is a language in which the verb typically comes before the object, about 53% of documented languages.</p><p>For example, Japanese would be considered an OV language, and English would be considered to be VO. A basic sentence demonstrating this would be as follows. </p> <dl><dd>Japanese: Inu ga <i>neko</i> (object) o <b>oikaketa</b> (verb)</dd> <dd>English: The dog <b>chased</b> (verb) the <i>cat</i> (object)</dd></dl><p>Winfred P. Lehmann is the first to propose the reduction of the six possible permutations of word order to just two main ones, VO and OV, in what he calls the Fundamental Principle of Placement (FPP), arguing that the subject is not a primary element of a sentence. VO languages are primarily right-branching, or head-initial: heads are generally found at the beginning of their phrases. </p><p>VO languages have a tendency to favor the use of prepositions instead of postpositions, with only 42 using postpositions of the documented 498 VO languages.</p><p>Some languages, such as Finnish, Hungarian, Russian, and Yiddish, use both VO and OV constructions, but in other instances, such as Early Middle English, some dialects may use VO and others OV. Languages that contain both OV and VO construction may solidify into one or the other construction. A language that moves the verb or verb phrase more than the object will have surface VO word order, and a language that moves the object more than the verb or verb phrase will have surface OV word order. </p>

<p>The <b>'apologetic'</b> or <b>parochial apostrophe</b> is the distinctive use of apostrophes in Modern Scots orthography. Apologetic apostrophes generally occurred where a consonant exists in the Standard English cognate, as in <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">a'</i></i> (all), <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">gi'e</i></i> (give) and <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">wi'</i></i> (with). </p><p>The practice, unknown in Older Scots, was introduced in the 18th century by writers such as Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns as part of a process of Anglicisation. The 18th-century practice was also adopted by later writers such as Walter Scott, John Galt and Robert Louis Stevenson. It produced an easily understood spurious Scots that was very popular with English readers and on the English stage. It was also sometimes forced on reluctant authors by publishers desirous of a wider circulation for their books.</p><p>The custom "also had the unfortunate effect of suggesting that Broad Scots was not a separate language system, but rather a divergent or inferior form of English". The use of the apologetic apostrophe became less widespread after the appearance of the 'Style Sheet' in 1947 and is now considered unacceptable, the apostrophe-less forms such as <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">aw</i></i> (all), <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">gie</i></i> (give) and <i><i lang="sco" title="Scots language text">wi</i></i> (with) being preferable. </p>

<p>The <b>languages of Taiwan</b> consist of several varieties of languages under families of Austronesian languages and Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in Taiwan. The Formosan languages, a branch of Austronesian languages, have been spoken by the Taiwanese aborigines in Taiwan for thousands of years. Researches on historical linguistics recognize Taiwan as the Urheimat (homeland) of the whole Austronesian languages family owing to the highest internal variety of the Formosan languages. In the last 400 years, several waves of Chinese emigrations brought several different Sino-Tibetan languages into Taiwan, these languages include Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, and Mandarin. These became the major languages of today's Taiwan, and make Taiwan an important center of Hokkien pop and Mandopop.  </p><p>Formosan languages were the dominant language of the Prehistory of Taiwan. The long colonial and immigration history of Taiwan brought in several languages such as Dutch, Spanish, Hokkien, Hakka, Japanese and Mandarin. Due to its colonial history, Japanese is also spoken and a large amount of loanwords from Japanese still exists in several languages of Taiwan. </p><p>After World War II, a long martial law era was held in Taiwan. Policies of the government in this era suppressed languages other than Mandarin in public use. This has significantly damaged the evolution of local languages including Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, Formosan languages and Matsu dialect. The situation has slightly changed after the 2000s. The government has put some efforts to protect and revitalize local languages. Local languages is now a part of elementary school education in Taiwan. Laws and regulations regarding local language protection were established for Hakka and Formosan languages. Public TV and radio stations exclusively for the two languages were also established. Currently, the government of Taiwan also maintains standards of several widely spoken languages listed below, the percentage of users are from the <i>2010 population and household census in Taiwan</i></p>

<p>The <b>Kish tablet</b> is a limestone tablet found at <b>Tell al-Uhaymir</b>, Babil Governorate, Iraq – the site of the ancient Sumerian city of Kish. A plaster-cast of the artifact is today in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum. </p><p>The Kish tablet is inscribed with proto-cuneiform signs. It has been dated to ca. 3500 BC (middle Uruk period), although some scholars believe it may be from somewhat later – Uruk IV period (ca. 3350–3200 BC). Several thousands of proto-cuneiform documents dating to Uruk IV and III periods (ca. 3350–3000 BC) have been found in Uruk. </p><p>The writing is still purely pictographic, and represents a transitional stage between proto-writing and the emergence of the partly syllabic writing of the cuneiform script proper. The "proto-literate period" of Egypt and Mesopotamia is taken to span about 3500 to 2900 BC. The administrative texts of the Jemdet Nasr period (3100–2900 BC), found among other places at Jemdet Nasr and Tell Uqair represent a further stage in the development from proto-cuneiform to cuneiform, but can still not be identified with certainty as being written in Sumerian, although it is likely.</p>
<p>The <b>Chellah</b> or <b>Shalla</b> (Berber languages: <span lang="ber"><b>Sla</b> or <b>Calla</b></span>; Arabic: <span lang="ar" dir="rtl">شالة</span>‎), is a medieval fortified Muslim necropolis located in the metro area of Rabat, Morocco, on the south (left) side of the Bou Regreg estuary. The Phoenicians established a trading emporium at the site and called it "Sala". This was later the site of the ancient Roman colony of "Sala Colonia", in the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana. </p><p>Salā was the name given to the city founded by the Muslim conquerors of North Africa, which was mostly abandoned during the Almohad era, then rebuilt by the Marinids in the 13th century. The  ruins of their medieval fortress are still extant. The Berber Almohads used the site as a royal burial ground. The Marinids made the site a holy necropolis, or <i>chellah</i>, and built a complex that included mosque, minaret, and royal tombs. The tall minaret of the now-ruined mosque was built of stone and zellige tilework, and still stands. </p><p>Contrary to legend, the corsairs of Salé did not actually operate out of Salé (called "Old Salé"), but out of the city that would later become known as Rabat, ("New Salé") on the south (left) bank of the Bou Regreg.</p>

<p><b>Dialectical naturalism</b> is a term coined by American philosopher Murray Bookchin to describe the philosophical underpinnings of the political program of social ecology. Dialectical naturalism explores the complex interrelationship between social problems, and the direct consequences they have on the ecological impact of human society. Bookchin offered dialectical naturalism as a contrast to what he saw as the "empyrean, basically antinaturalistic dialectical idealism" of Hegel, and "the wooden, often scientistic dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxists".</p>
<p><b>Truman Michelson</b> (1879–1938) was a linguist and anthropologist who worked from 1910 until his death for the Bureau of American Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution. He also held a position as ethnologist at George Washington University from 1917 until 1932.</p><p>Michelson studied Indo-European historical linguistics at Harvard University, completing his doctoral degree in 1904, with further study at the Universities of Leipzig and Bonn in 1904-1905, followed by study with Franz Boas.</p><p>Soon after joining the Bureau of American Ethnology, Michelson began an extensive program of field research on North American Indian languages. Much of Michelson's research focused on languages of the Algonquian family. Bibliographies of his publications are available in Boas (1938), Cooper (1939), and Pentland and Wolfart (1982). He was the author of an early influential study classifying the Algonquian languages, although extensive further research has entirely superseded Michelson's pioneering effort.</p><p>Much of his research focused on the Fox people and language, resulting in an extensive list of publications on Fox ethnology and linguistics.  Michelson employed native speakers of the language to write Fox stories in the Fox version of the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary, resulting in a large collection of unpublished materials. Goddard (1991, 1996) discusses the material in some of these texts.  A significant text from this corpus, <i>The Owl Sacred Pack,</i> has recently been published. One of the texts obtained in this manner that Michelson did publish, <i>The autobiography of a Fox Indian woman,</i> is now available in a more complete edition, with a revised transcription of the original text and comprehensive linguistic analysis.</p><p>Michelson also assisted in the posthumous preparation and publication of a number of draft manuscripts left unpublished after the premature death of William Jones. Among these were: (a) a significant two-volume collection of Ojibwe texts with translations that Jones had obtained in northwestern Ontario at Fort William Ojibwa reserve, and near Lake Nipigon, in addition to stories collected in northern Minnesota; (b) a volume of Kickapoo texts; and (c) an article on Fox for the first Handbook of American Indian languages.</p><p>He also undertook field research on, among others, Arapaho; Shawnee; Peoria; Kickapoo; Munsee and Unami, the two closely related Delaware languages; collected notes and texts in the syllabic script from Cree dialects in Québec and northern Ontario; physical anthropology notes on Blackfoot and Cheyenne; Eskimo texts from Great Whale River, Québec, and others. A comprehensive list of all of Michelson’s archival materials in the National Anthropological Archives at the Smithsonian Institution is available online.</p><p>Michelson was involved in a prominent debate with Edward Sapir because of his rejection of Sapir's proposal that the Algonquian languages were related to Wiyot and Yurok, two languages of California, through common membership in the Algic language family. Although he strongly criticized Sapir's proposal, the historical links between Algonquian, Yurok, and Wiyot are now accepted as being beyond dispute.</p>

<p><b>Mahasu Pahari</b> is a Western Pahari(Himachali) language spoken in Himachal Pradesh. It is also known as Mahasui or Mahasuvi. The speaking population is about 1,000,000 (2001). It is more commonly spoken in the Himachal Pradesh, Shimla (Simla) and Solan districts. It is to be known that Shimla and Solan were parts of the old Mahasu district. Himachal Pradesh State on 1 September, 1972 reorganised the districts dissolving Mahasu district. The Solan district was carved out of Solan and Arki tehsils of the then Mahasu district and tehsils of Kandaghat and Nalagarh of the then Shimla District. </p><p>It is classified as Indo-European, Indo-Iranian, Indo-Aryan, Northern zone, Western Pahari. According to different locations, the language has developed several dialects. Lower Mahasu Pahari (Baghati, Baghliani, Kiunthali), Upper Mahasu Pahari (Rampuri, Rohruri, Shimla Siraji, Sodochi). The Kiunthali variety appears to be understood by others, and their attitude toward it is favorable. Rampuri is also called Kochi; Rohruri is also called Soracholi and Sodochi spoken in Kotgarh. Intelligibility among dialects is above 85%. Lexical similarity is 74%–82% with upper dialects, and 74%–95% with lower dialects. The language is used in home and for religious purposes. It is understood and spoken from people of vital age group. The educated are more proficient in Hindi and English. It is considered to be highly endangered as the number of people speaking it is constantly going down. It is also to be noted that "Sirmauri" spoken in Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh and in neighbouring jaunsar-bawar of Uttrakhand more or less share the same roots down to the Mahasu/Mahasui language. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The <b>Mayan languages</b> form a language family spoken in Mesoamerica and northern Central America. Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million Maya peoples, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognizes eight more within its territory.</p><p>The Mayan language family is one of the best-documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from the Proto-Mayan language, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Ch'olan-Tzeltalan branches. </p><p>Mayan languages form part of the Mesoamerican language area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use relational nouns instead of prepositions to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess grammatical and typological features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of ergativity in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special word class of "positionals" which is typical of all Mayan languages. </p><p>During the pre-Columbian era of Mesoamerican history, some Mayan languages were written in the logo-syllabic Maya script. Its use was particularly widespread during the Classic period of Maya civilization (c. 250–900). The surviving corpus of over 10,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper codices, combined with the rich postcolonial literature in Mayan languages written in the Latin script, provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas. </p>

<p>A <b>corpus language</b> is a language without living speakers, while a number of the actual productions of the native speakers have been preserved in some way (usually in written records). Examples of corpus languages are Ancient Greek, Latin, the Egyptian Language, Old English and Elamite.  </p><p>Some corpus language left a very large corpus, like Ancient Greek and Latin, and therefore can be totally reconstucted, even though some details of the pronunciation may be unclear. Such languages can be used even today, as is the case with Sanskrit and Latin. Others have such a limited corpus that some important words, e.g. some pronouns, are not found in the corpus. Examples for this are Ugaritic and Gothic. Languages that are only attested by a few words, often names, and a few phrases (called <i>Trümmersprachen</i> in German linguistics, literally "rubble languages") can only be reconstructed in a very limited way and often their genetic relationship to other languages remains unclear. Examples are the Lombardic language and Dadanitic, a Semitic language that is may be close to classical Arabic. </p><p>Corpus languages are studied using the methods of corpus linguistics, but corpus linguistics can be used (and is commonly used) for the study of the recorded productions of living languages. </p><p>Not all extinct languages are "corpus languages," since many languages have disappeared leaving no, or very inadequate, recorded production of their speakers. </p>

<p>The <b>Tibeto-Burman languages</b> are the non-Sinitic members of the Sino-Tibetan language family, over 400 of which are spoken throughout the highlands of Southeast Asia as well as certain parts of East Asia and South Asia. Around 60 million people speak Tibeto-Burman languages, around half of whom speak Burmese, and 13% of whom speak Tibetic languages. The name derives from the most widely spoken of these languages, namely Burmese (over 32 million speakers) and the Tibetic languages (over 8 million). These languages also have extensive literary traditions, dating from the 12th and 7th centuries respectively. Most of the other languages are spoken by much smaller communities, and many of them have not been described in detail. </p><p>Some taxonomies divide Sino-Tibetan into Sinitic and Tibeto-Burman branches (e.g. Benedict, Matisoff). However, other scholars deny that Tibeto-Burman comprises a monophyletic group. Van Driem argues that the Sino-Tibetan family should be called "Tibeto-Burman", but this usage has not been widely adopted. Others exclude a relationship with Chinese altogether (e.g. Beckwith, R. A. Miller). </p>
<p><b>Abahattha</b> (Prakrit: <i>abasatta</i>, Bengali: <span lang="bn">অবহট্‌ঠ</span> <i>ôbôhôtthô</i>, ultimately from Sanskrit <i>apaśabda</i>; "meaningless sound") is a stage in the evolution of the Eastern group of Indo-Aryan languages. The eastern group consists of languages such as Bengali, Maithili,  Assamese and Oriya. Abahatta is also called <b>Apabhramsa Avahatta</b>, <b>Apabhramsha Abahatta</b> or <b>Purvi Apabhramsa</b>. Abahatta is considered to follow the Apabhraṃśa stage, i.e. those Apabhraṃśas derived from Magadhi Prakrit. </p><p>Abahatta, which existed from the 6th century to 14th century, was contemporaneous with some Apabhraṃśas as well as the early modern languages such as Old Oriya, Old Bengali, Old Maithili and Old Assamese.

<p>The <b>transitive case</b> is a grammatical case used in a small number of languages to mark either argument of a transitive verb, but not used with intransitive verbs.  Such a situation, which is quite rare among the world's languages, has also been called a <i>double-oblique</i> clause structure. </p><p>Rushani, an Iranian dialect, has this case in the past tense. That is, in the past tense, the agent and object of a transitive verb are marked with the same case ending, while the subject of an intransitive verb is not marked. In the present tense, the object of the transitive verb is marked, the other two roles are not – that is, a typical nominative–accusative alignment.</p><p><b>Intransitive: no case marking</b> </p> <dl><dd></dd></dl><dl><dd>'I went to Xorog'</dd></dl><p><b>Transitive, past tense:  double case marking </b> </p> <dl><dd></dd></dl><dl><dd>'I saw you'</dd> <dd>(double oblique: literally 'me saw thee')</dd></dl><p><b>Transitive, present tense:  accusative case marking </b> </p> <dl><dd></dd></dl><dl><dd>'I see you'</dd> <dd>(nominative–accusative)</dd></dl><p>According to Payne, it's clear what happened here: Rushani once had a split-ergative alignment, as is common in the area, where the object was marked (oblique) in the present tense, but the agent was marked in the past. The case forms of the object were then leveled, and with the marking applied to the past tense as well. However, this resulted in a complication, the typologically unusual situation where the agent and object are treated the same, and different from the intransitive subject. Given its rarity, one might expect such a system to be unstable, and indeed it appears to be changing. Payne reports that younger speakers change the past-tense construction to one of the following, either using the absolutive (= nominative) inflection for the agent: </p> <dl><dd></dd></dl><dl><dd>'I saw you'</dd> <dd>(nominative–accusative)</dd></dl><p>or secondarily marking the object as an object, using the preposition <i>az</i> (literally 'from'): </p> <dl><dd></dd></dl><dl><dd>'I saw you'</dd> <dd>(effectively, accusative and double-accusative)</dd></dl>
<p><b>Basque dialects</b> are linguistic varieties of the Basque language which differ in pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar from each other and from Standard Basque. Between six and nine Basque dialects have been historically distinguished: </p> <ul><li>Biscayan</li> <li>Gipuzkoan</li> <li>Upper Navarrese (Northern and Southern)</li> <li>Lower Navarrese (Eastern and Western)</li> <li>Lapurdian</li> <li>Souletin (Souletin and Roncalese)</li></ul><p>In modern times, however, both Lower Navarrese and Lapurdian are considered part of a Navarrese–Lapurdian dialect, so there would be five dialects, divided into 11 subdialects and 24 minor varieties.</p>  <p>The boundaries of all these dialects do not coincide directly with current political or administrative boundaries. It was believed that the dialect boundaries between Bizkaian, Gipuzkoan and Upper Navarrese showed some relation to some pre-Roman tribal boundaries between the Caristii, Varduli and Vascones. However, main Basque dialectologists now deny any direct relation between those tribes and Basque dialects. It seems that these dialects were created in the Middle Ages from a previously quite unified Basque language, and the dialects diverged from each other since then as a result of the administrative and political division that happened in the Basque Country.</p>

<p>Iceland has been a very isolated and linguistically homogeneous island historically, but has nevertheless been home to several languages. Gaelic was the native language to many of the early Icelanders. Although the Icelandic or Norse language prevails, northern trade routes brought German, English, Dutch, French and Basque to Iceland. Some merchants and clergymen settled in Iceland throughout the centuries, leaving their mark on culture, but linguistically mainly trade, nautical, and religious terms. Excluding these and Latin words, Icelandic has been altered remarkably little since settlement. </p><p>Icelandic is not only the national language, but is now “the official language in Iceland” by virtue of Act No 61/2011, adopted by parliament in 2011. Icelandic Sign Language was also officially recognised by law in 2011 as a minority language with constitutional rights and the first language of the Icelandic deaf community. During the time of Danish rule, Danish was a minority language in Iceland, although it is nowadays only spoken by a small number of immigrants. </p><p>Studying English and Danish (or another Scandinavian language) is mandatory for students in compulsory schools and also part of many secondary-level study programmes, so knowledge of the two languages is widespread.

<p><b>JavaScript Style Sheets</b> (<b>JSSS</b>) was a stylesheet language technology proposed by Netscape Communications Corporation in 1996 to provide facilities for defining the presentation of webpages. It was an alternative to the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) technology. Although  Netscape submitted it to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the technology was never accepted as a formal standard and it never gained much acceptance in the market. Only Netscape Communicator 4 supported JSSS, with the rival Internet Explorer web browser choosing not to implement the technology. Soon after Netscape Communicator's release in 1997, Netscape stopped promoting JSSS, instead focusing on the rival CSS standard, which was also supported by Internet Explorer and had a much wider industry acceptance. The follow-up to Netscape Communicator, Netscape 6 (released in 2000), dropped support for JSSS. It now remains little more than a historical footnote, with many Web developers not even being aware of its existence. The proposed standard was not finished. </p><p>Using JavaScript code as a stylesheet, JSSS styles individual element by modifying properties of the document.tags object. For example, the CSS: </p>  <p>is equivalent to the JSSS: </p>  <p>JSSS element names are case sensitive. </p><p>JSSS lacks the various CSS selector features, supporting only simple tag name, class and id selectors. On the other hand, since it is written using a complete programming language, stylesheets can include highly complex dynamic calculations and conditional processing. (In practice, however, this can be achieved as Dynamic CSS by using JavaScript to modify the stylesheets applicable to the document at runtime.) Because of this JSSS was often used in the creation of DHTML. </p>

<p>A peculiarity of <b>Venetian grammar</b> is a "semi-analytical" verbal flexion, with a compulsory "clitic subject pronoun" before the verb in many sentences, "echoing" the subject as an ending or a weak pronoun. As will be clear from the examples below, Venetian subject clitics are neither "redundant" nor "pleonastic" because they provide specific information, not present on verbal endings. Independent/emphatic pronouns (e.g. <i>ti</i>), on the contrary, are optional. </p> <ul><li>Italian: <i>(Tu) eri sporco</i>  ("You were dirty").</li> <li>Venetian: <i>(Ti) te jèra onto</i> or even <i>Ti te jèri/xeri onto</i> (lit. "(You) you were dirty").</li> <li>Italian: <i>Il cane era sporco</i>  ("The dog was dirty").</li> <li>Venetian: <i>El can el jèra onto</i>  (lit. "The dog he was dirty").</li> <li>Italian: <i>(Tu) ti sei domandato</i> ("You have asked yourself").</li> <li>Venetian: <i>(Ti) te te à/gà/ghè domandà</i>  (lit. "(You) you yourself have asked").</li></ul><p>The clitic subject pronoun (<i>te, el/ła, i/łe</i>) is used with the 2nd and 3rd person singular, and with the 3rd person plural.  This feature may have arisen as a compensation for the fact that the 2nd- and 3rd-person inflections for most verbs, which are still distinct in Italian and many other Romance languages, are identical in Venetian. (The Piedmontese language also has clitic subject pronouns, but the rules are somewhat different.) </p><p>The function of clitics is particularly visible in long sentences, which do not always have clear intonational breaks to easily tell apart vocative and imperative in sharp commands from exclamations with "shouted indicative". In Venetian the clitic <i>el</i> marks the indicative verb and its masculine subject, otherwise there is an imperative preceded by a vocative: </p> <ul><li>Venetian: <i>Marco 'l canta ben, dai!</i> ("Mark <i>(subj.)</i> sings well, you have to admit it!" - exclamation: subject + indicative)</li> <li>Venetian: <i>Marco canta ben, dai!</i> ("Mark <i>(voc.)</i> sing well, come on!" - command: vocative+imperative)</li> <li>Ven.Ital.: <i>Marco canta ben, dai!</i> (both exclamative and imperative)</li> <li>Std.Ital.: <i>Marco canta bene, dai!</i> (both exclamative and imperative)</li></ul><p>Indeed, the verbal forms requiring subject clitics can often change or even drop their endings without problems of confusion because the clitic itself provide the necessary information (in Piedmontese and Milanese the clitic is not sufficient to mark the verb and often requires the cooccurence of a specific ending). Because Venetian subject clitics mark number (e.g. <i>te</i> = 2nd singular, <i>el</i> = 3rd singular, <i>i</i> = 3rd plural) and gender (<i>ła</i> = feminine 3rd singular, <i>łe</i> = feminine 3rd plural), they convey specific information that is not (or might not be) present on the endings. Thus, they act like a bridge that provide number and gender agreement between verb and subject (some languages, like Hebrew or Basque may show number/gender agreement on verbal endings). Thus, although some traditional grammars consider subject clitics as "redundant" or "pleonastic" elements, Venetian subject clitics are neither redundant nor pleonastic. </p><p>The clitics are the same in whole Veneto with two exceptions: <i>te</i> becomes <i>ti</i> in Venice (but is different from emphatic <i>TI</i>!) and becomes <i>tu</i> in some bellunese areas. <i>El</i> becomes <i>Al</i> in bellunese. </p>

<p>Feminist language reform has proposed gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender, such as Spanish. Grammatical gender in Spanish refers to how Spanish nouns are categorized as either masculine (often ending in <i>-o</i>) or feminine (often ending in <i>-a</i>). As in other Romance languages—such as Portuguese, to which Spanish is very similar—a group of both males and females, or someone of unknown gender, is usually referred to by the masculine form of a nouns and or pronoun. Advocates of gender-neutral language modification consider this to be sexist, and favor new ways of writing and speaking. Activists against sexism in language are also concerned about words whose feminine form has a different (usually less prestigious) meaning. </p>

The language was used as literary language as early as the 12th century. Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun forms, postpositions, and auxiliary verbs. It had three genders, as Gujarati does today, and by around the time of 1300 CE, a fairly standardized form of this language emerged. While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name of <b>Old Western Rajasthani</b>, based on the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not yet distinct. Factoring into this preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender, based on the incorrect conclusion that the [ũ] that came to be pronounced in some areas for masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati's neuter [ũ].

<p><b>Cape Flats English</b> (abbreviated <b>CFE</b>) or <b>Coloured English</b> is the variety of South African English spoken mostly in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town.

It was he who popularized the theory that the Aryan race had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the Nordic characteristics of blue eyes and blond hair. In his <i>Origines Ariacae</i> ('Origins of the Aryans') of 1883 he proposed that the Indo-European homeland was in the far north, the Hyperborea of antiquity.

<p><b>Lexicology</b> is the part of linguistics that studies words. This may include  their nature and function as symbols, their meaning, the relationship of their meaning to epistemology in general, and the rules of their composition from smaller elements (morphemes such as the English <i>-ed</i> marker for past or <i>un-</i> for negation; and phonemes as basic sound units). Lexicology also involves relations between words, which may involve semantics (for example, <i>love</i> vs. <i>affection</i>), derivation (for example, <i>fathom</i> vs. <i>unfathomably</i>), use and sociolinguistic distinctions (for example, <i>flesh</i> vs. <i>meat</i>), and any other issues involved in analyzing the whole lexicon of a language. </p><p>The term first appeared in the 1970s, though there were lexicologists in essence before the term was coined. Computational lexicology is a related field (in the same way that computational linguistics is related to linguistics) that deals with the computational study of dictionaries and their contents. </p><p>An allied science to lexicology is lexicography, which also studies words, but primarily in relation with dictionaries – it is concerned with the inclusion of words in dictionaries and from that perspective with the whole lexicon. Sometimes lexicography is considered to be a part or a branch of lexicology, but properly speaking, only lexicologists who actually write dictionaries are lexicographers. Some consider this a distinction of theory vs. practice. </p>

<p>In discourse-based grammatical theory, <b>information flow</b> is any tracking of referential information by speakers. Information may be <i>new,</i> just introduced into the conversation; <i>given,</i> already active in the speakers' consciousness; or <i>old,</i> no longer active. The various types of activation, and how these are defined, are model-dependent. </p><p>Information flow affects grammatical structures such as:  </p> <ul><li>word order (topic, focus, and afterthought constructions).</li> <li>active, passive, or middle voice.</li> <li>choice of deixis, such as articles; "medial" deictics such as Spanish <i>ese</i> and Japanese <i>sore</i> are generally determined by the familiarity of a referent rather than by physical distance.</li> <li>overtness of information, such as whether an argument of a verb is indicated by a lexical noun phrase, a pronoun, or not mentioned at all.</li> <li>Clefting: Splitting a single clause into two clauses, each with its own verb, e.g. ‘The chicken turtles tasted like chicken.’ becomes ‘It was the chicken turtle | that tasted like chicken.’ In this case, clefting is used to shift the focus of the sentence to the subject, chicken turtle.</li> <li>Front Focus: Placing at the start (front) of a sentence information that would normally occur later in the sentence, to give it extra prominence. For example, in pop culture, Grand Master of the Jedi Order Yoda's speech often utilises such syntactic construction, such as when he says 'much to learn you still have' to Luke Skywalker.</li> <li>End Focus (End Weight): Given or familiar information followed by new information. This gives prominence to the final part of the sentences and can enable suspense to build, e.g. ‘Through the door came a gigantic wolf’.(Umer Prince)</li></ul>

<p><b>Nyquist</b> is a programming language for sound synthesis and analysis based on the Lisp programming language. It is an extension of the XLISP dialect of Lisp, and is named after Harry Nyquist.</p><p>With Nyquist, the programmer designs musical instruments by combining functions, and can call upon these instruments and generate a sound just by typing a simple expression. The programmer can combine simple expressions into complex ones to create a whole composition, and can also generate various other kinds of musical and non-musical sounds.</p><p>The Nyquist interpreter can read and write sound files, MIDI files, and Adagio text-based music score files.  On many platforms, it can also produce direct audio output in real time. </p><p>The Nyquist programming language can also be used to write plug-in effects for the Audacity digital audio editor.</p><p>One notable difference between Nyquist and more traditional MUSIC-N languages is that Nyquist does not segregate synthesis functions (see unit generator) from "scoring" functions. For example Csound is actually two languages, one for creating "orchestras" the other for writing "scores". With Nyquist these two domains are combined. </p><p>Nyquist runs under Linux and other Unix environments, Mac OS, and Microsoft Windows. </p><p>The Nyquist programming language and interpreter were written by Roger Dannenberg at Carnegie Mellon University, with support from Yamaha Corporation and IBM.</p>
<p>The modern <b>Japanese writing system</b> uses a combination of logographic kanji, which are adopted Chinese characters, and syllabic kana. Kana itself consists of a pair of syllabaries: hiragana, used primarily for native or naturalised Japanese words and grammatical elements, and katakana, used primarily for foreign words and names, loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific names, and sometimes for emphasis. Almost all written Japanese sentences contain a mixture of kanji and kana. Because of this mixture of scripts, in addition to a large inventory of kanji characters, the Japanese writing system is often considered to be the most complicated in use anywhere in the world.</p><p>Several thousand kanji characters are in regular use. Each has an intrinsic meaning (or range of meanings), and most have more than one pronunciation, the choice of which depends on context. Japanese primary and secondary school students are required to learn 2,136 <i>jōyō kanji</i> as of 2010. The total number of kanji is well over 50,000, though few if any native speakers know anywhere near this number.</p><p>In modern Japanese, the hiragana and katakana syllabaries each contain 46 basic characters, or 71 including diacritics. With one or two minor exceptions, each different sound in the Japanese language (that is, each different syllable, strictly each mora) corresponds to one character in each syllabary. Unlike kanji, these characters intrinsically represent sounds only; they convey meaning only as part of words. Hiragana and katakana characters also originally derive from Chinese characters, but they have been simplified and modified to such an extent that their origins are no longer visually obvious. The principle of the syllabic script itself is thought to have been borrowed from the Indian Sanskritic Siddham script. </p><p>Texts without kanji are rare; most are either children's books—since children tend to know few kanji at an early age—and early electronics such as computers, phones, and videogames, which could not display complex graphemes like kanji due to both graphical and technological limitations.</p><p>To a lesser extent, modern written Japanese also uses acronyms from the Latin alphabet, for example in terms such as  "BC/AD", "a.m./p.m.", "FBI", and "CD". Romanized Japanese is most frequently used by foreign students of Japanese who have not yet mastered kana, and by native speakers for computer input. </p>

<p><b>Urkers</b> is the local language of the municipality and former island of Urk, located on the west coast of the Dutch province of Flevoland. Urk was an island until the middle of the 20th century. It was originally located in the Zuiderzee, a bay of the North sea, which became an inland sea called IJsselmeer when a dam was built to secure the Dutch coast against floods. Inhabitants of Urk had been mostly fishermen and still predominantly make their living from North Sea fishing. </p><p>Urkers is part of the dialect continuum that links Dutch Low Saxon dialects in the North and East of Urk to the Lower Franconian dialects, mainly in the South, West, and North-West of Urk.

Urkers is considered a part of the Low Saxon group of languages despite the fact that it is quite extreme in that group and both geographically and linguistically at its edge. Lower Saxon has its main distribution in Northern Germany in the federal states Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. For native speakers from those areas, it is unlikely to understand Urkers well. </p>
<p>  <b>Malcolm Guthrie</b> (10 February 1903 – 22 November 1972) was a professor of Bantu languages at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. He is known primarily for his classification of Bantu languages, Guthrie 1971. The classification, though based more on geography than linguistic relatedness, is nonetheless the most widely used. Together with the Belgian linguist Achille Émile Meeussen (1912–1978), he is regarded as one of the two leading Bantu specialists of the second half of the 20th century.</p><p>Malcolm Guthrie was born in Hove, Sussex, England, the son of a Scottish father and a mother of Dutch extraction. After schooling at Ipswich, he took a degree in metallurgy at Imperial College, London. Shortly afterwards, however, he felt called to the Baptist ministry. He served for two years as minister of a Baptist church in Rochester, during which time he married Margaret Near, the daughter of a Baptist minister at a neighbouring church. In 1932 he went as a missionary to Kinshasa in the then Belgian Congo, where he worked for the next eight years. It was here that he studied the Lingala language and several other local languages.</p><p>Guthrie's first major work was <i>The Classification of the Bantu Languages</i> (1948), in which he tried to define the set of Bantu languages. It was in this work that the first version of the famous coding of these languages into geographical "zones" first appeared.</p><p>The magnum opus of Guthrie is <i>Comparative Bantu</i>, which appeared in 4 volumes published in 1967 (volume 1), 1970 (volumes 3 and 4), and 1971 (volume 2). The 4 volumes provide not only a genetic classification but also a reconstruction of Proto-Bantu as the Proto-language of the Bantu language family. For his reconstruction, Guthrie drew data from 28 so-called "test languages" that were picked more or less randomly. It has been argued, for example by Wilhelm Möhlig, that this renders his reconstruction unreliable, since the reconstructed forms, and hence the genetic tree, would be different if one changed the selection of languages.</p><p>Guthrie also published extensively on a wide range of Bantu languages, including Lingala, Bemba, Mfinu, and Teke. </p>

<p><b>Yurí</b> (Jurí) is, or was, a language previously spoken near a stretch of the Caquetá River in the Brazilian Amazon, extending slightly into Colombia. A small amount of data was collected on two occasions in the 19th century, in 1853 and 1867. Kaufman (1994:62, after Nimuendajú 1977:62) notes that there is good lexical evidence to support a link with Ticuna in a Ticuna–Yurí language family, though the data has never been explicitly compared (Hammarström 2010). </p><p>It is commonly assumed that the Yuri people and language survive among the uncontacted people or peoples of the Rio Puré region, now the Río Puré National Park. Indeed, "Yuri" is often used as a synonym for the only named people in the area, the Carabayo. A list of words collected in 1969 from the Carabayo, only recovered in 2013, suggests the language is close to Yuri, though perhaps not a direct descendent. </p>

<p>The <b>language policies of Canada's province and territories</b> vary substantially between different regions and also between different eras. </p><p>From the 1890s until the 1960s, English was the only language in which most government services were provided outside of Quebec (which was functionally bilingual) and using French in the courts or in schools was often illegal. These developments led to fears by French-Canadian nationalists that French speakers would be assimilated into the increasingly Anglophone culture of Ontario, leading the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969) to recommend that the Government of Canada and all provinces offer more services in French. </p><p>Since that time, Quebec has used provincial law to encourage the use of French (see Charter of the French Language) at the expense of other languages, while the other provinces have begun to offer more and more services in French and in other languages besides English, including Aboriginal languages and immigrant languages. The 1982 amendments to the Constitution of Canada included a right of minority-language education that has forced policy changes in all of the provinces. Quebec is unique in requiring private businesses to use French and requiring immigrants to send their children to French-language schools. In other provinces there is no requirement that businesses use a particular language, but English predominates, and immigrants may send their children to English, French or third-language schools.</p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>  <p>The <b>Nueva Planta decrees</b> (Spanish: <i lang="es">Decretos de Nueva Planta</i>, Catalan: <i lang="ca">Decrets de Nova Planta</i>) were a number of decrees signed between 1707 and 1716 by Philip V—the first Bourbon King of Spain—during and shortly after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession by the Treaty of Utrecht. </p><p>Angered by what he saw as sedition by the Aragonese and taking his native France as a model of a centralised state, King Felipe V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient charters (Spanish: <i>fueros</i>, Catalan: <i>furs</i>) of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the Aran Valley were to be ruled by the laws of Castile ("the most praiseworthy in all the Universe" according to the 1707 decree), embedding these regions in a new, and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain. </p><p>The other historic territories—Navarre and the other Basque territories—supported Felipe V initially, whom they saw as belonging to the lineage of Henry III of Navarre, but after Felipe V's military campaign to crush the Basque uprising, he backed down on his intent to suppress home rule. </p><p>The acts abolishing the charters were promulgated in 1707 in Valencia and Aragon, in 1715 in Majorca and the other Balearic Islands (with the exception of Menorca, a possession of the Kingdom of Great Britain at the time), and finally in Catalonia on 16 January 1716.</p><p>The decrees effectively created a Spanish citizenship or nationality, that judicially did not distinguish between Castilian and Aragonese anymore, both with respect to rights and law. They abolished internal borders and customs except for the Basque territory, giving grant to all Spaniards to trade with American colonies (not only Castilians, as before). </p><p>Felipe of Bourbon won the War of the Spanish Succession and imposed unification policies over the Crown of Aragon, which had supported the claim of Karl of Austria. These acts constituted the first successful realisation of Spain as a centralised state and were meant both as a modernising element, in line with other European countries where their monarchs were increasing their powers, and also as a punishment on these territories which had fought against Felipe V in the War of Succession. Henceforth, top civil servants were appointed directly from Madrid, the King's court city, and  most institutions in these territories were abolished. Court cases could only be presented and argued in Castilian, which became the sole language of government, displacing Latin, Catalan and other Spanish languages. </p>

<p>In computer science, <b>SLR grammars</b> are the class of formal grammars accepted by a Simple LR parser.  SLR grammars are a superset of all LR(0) grammars and a subset of all LALR(1) and LR(1) grammars. </p><p>When processed by an SLR parser, an SLR grammar is converted into parse tables with no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts for any combination of LR(0) parser state and expected lookahead symbol.  If the grammar is not SLR, the parse tables will have shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts for some state and some lookahead symbols, and the resulting rejected parser is no longer deterministic.  The parser cannot decide whether to shift or reduce next, or cannot decide between two candidate reductions.  SLR parsers use a Follow(A) calculation to pick the lookahead symbols to expect for every completed nonterminal.   </p><p>LALR parsers use a different calculation which sometimes gives smaller, tighter lookahead sets for the same parser states.  Those smaller sets can eliminate overlap with the state's shift actions, and overlap with lookaheads for other reductions in this same state.  The overlap conflicts reported by SLR parsers are then spurious, a result of the approximate calculation using Follow(A). </p><p>A grammar which is ambiguous will have unavoidable shift/reduce conflicts or reduce/reduce conflicts for every LR analysis method, including SLR.  A common way for computer language grammars to be ambiguous is if some nonterminal is both left- and right-recursive: </p> <dl><dd><dl><dd>Expr → Expr * Val</dd> <dd>Expr → Val + Expr</dd> <dd>Expr → Val</dd></dl></dd></dl><p><br></p>

<p>In grammar, a <b>tense confusion</b> occurs when a writer shifts from the present tense to the past tense (or vice versa).  For example, in the following example, the change from "saw" (past tense) to "is" (present tense) represents a tense confusion: </p><p>Example: </p> <blockquote><p>He <i>saw</i> that she <i>is</i> very tall.</p></blockquote> <p>It is important to avoid tense confusions because they hurt reader comprehension.

Illiterate until 13, he showed no early signs of linguistic ability, but despite this late start, at age 17 he was appointed schoolmaster of the village of Stralock. </p><p>Shortly after this he attended Kirkmichael school followed by Perth Grammar School and the University of St. Andrews, gaining a master's degree from the latter. </p><p>In 1823 he took a post at Calcutta Academy, but because of poor health he was forced to return to Europe in 1826. In 1837 he became Professor of Oriental Languages at King's College London and stayed at this post until his retirement in 1861. During his time at King's College London he also worked at the British Museum, cataloguing the collection of Persian manuscripts. </p><p>During his life he wrote a number of books, and it is for these which he is most remembered.

<p>In the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), an <b>entity</b> is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as <code>#DEFAULT</code>). Entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of SGML documents. The SGML specification defines numerous <b>entity types</b>, which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context. An entity string value may variously consist of plain text, SGML tags, and/or references to previously-defined entities. Certain entity types may also invoke external documents. Entities are called by reference. </p>
<p>  <b>Sreekanteswaram G. Padmanabha Pillai</b> (1864–1946), popularly known as <i>Sreekanteswaram</i>,  was a lexicographer and scholar best known for his Malayalam dictionary <i>Sabdatharavali</i>. </p><p>Padmanabha Pillai was born in Sreekanteswaram in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum). He studied English, Tamil and Sanskrit and wrote <i>Duryodhanavadham</i> and <i>Dharmaguptavadham</i> at a young age. He later worked as a lawyer. </p><p>He started his work on <i>Sabdatharavali</i> at the age of 32. The first part of the book came out in 1918. The dictionary, which runs into more than 1600 pages, took twenty years to complete. His son P. Damodara Pillai later compiled a concise version. Padmanabha Pillai also prepared a pocket dictionary in 1906. </p><p>Padmanabha Pillai wrote around sixty books in his lifetime.

<p><b>Open syllable lengthening</b>, in linguistics, is the process by which short vowels become long in an open syllable. It occurs in many languages at a phonetic or allophonic level, and no meaningful distinction in length is made. However, as it became phonemic in many Germanic languages, it is especially significant in them, both historically and in the modern languages. </p><p>Open syllable lengthening affected the stressed syllables of all Germanic languages in their history to some degree. Curiously, it seems to have affected the languages around a similar time, between the 12th and the 16th centuries, during the late Middle Ages. The languages differ mainly as to the specific vowels that were lengthened the specific environment but also in the result of the lengthening. There is substantial variation, and in many languages, the process has been largely undone by paradigmatic levelling. Sometimes, the newly-lengthened vowels merged with existing long vowels, but in other languages, they remained distinct because the older long vowels underwent changes of their own such as in Icelandic and, to a lesser degree, the Scandinavian languages. </p><p>The lengthening often also applied in reverse at some point by shortening long vowels in closed syllables. As a consequence of the combination of the two changes, vowel length and consonant length came to be in complementary distribution: one of the two features is no longer distinctive but is predictable from the other. </p><p>Many languages later shortened the long consonants. That had consequences for spelling, as consonant length was generally marked by doubling in the various Germanic languages, but vowel length was not. The doubled consonants then came to be used as an indicator for vowel length and, later, quality). That feature is seen in most Germanic languages today. </p><p>Some Germanic varieties such as High Alemannic German have no general open syllabic lengthening. It may be restricted to a few cases before sonorant consonants, as in Bernese German <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈv̥aːrə]</span> ('to drive') or <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˈtæːlər]</span> ('valleys'), or it may not occur at all, as in Walser German. Consequently, the varieties feature both distinctive vowel length and distinctive consonant length. </p>

<p><b>Graphocentrism</b> or scriptism is a typically unconscious interpretative bias in which writing is privileged over speech.</p><p>Biases in favor of the written or printed word are closely associated with the ranking of sight above sound, the eye above the ear, which has been called 'ocularcentrism'.It opposes phonocentrism, which is the bias in favor of speech. </p>
<p><b>Head-driven phrase structure grammar</b> (<b>HPSG</b>) is a highly lexicalized, constraint-based grammar developed by Carl Pollard and Ivan Sag. It is a type of phrase structure grammar, as opposed to a dependency grammar, and it is the immediate successor to generalized phrase structure grammar. HPSG draws from other fields such as computer science (data type theory and knowledge representation) and uses Ferdinand de Saussure's notion of the sign. It uses a uniform formalism and is organized in a modular way which makes it attractive for natural language processing. </p><p>An HPSG grammar includes principles and grammar rules and lexicon entries which are normally not considered to belong to a grammar. The formalism is based on lexicalism. This means that the lexicon is more than just a list of entries; it is in itself richly structured. Individual entries are marked with types. Types form a hierarchy.  Early versions of the grammar were very lexicalized with few grammatical rules (schema).  More recent research has tended to add more and richer rules, becoming more like construction grammar.</p><p>The basic type HPSG deals with is the sign. Words and phrases are two different subtypes of sign. A word has two features: <i>[PHON]</i> (the sound, the phonetic form) and <i>[SYNSEM]</i> (the syntactic and semantic information), both of which are split into subfeatures. Signs and rules are formalized as typed feature structures. </p>
<p>The <b>Visayans</b> (Visayan: <i>Mga Bisaya</i>; <small>local pronunciation: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[bi-sa-ya]</span>) is an umbrella term for the Philippine ethnolinguistic groups native to the whole Visayas, the southernmost islands of Luzon and most parts of Mindanao. Those particularly within the Visayas broadly share a sea-based culture with strong Roman Catholic traditions merged with cultural elements through centuries of interaction and inter-migrations mainly across the seas of Visayan, Sibuyan, Camotes and Bohol, and in some secluded areas merged with ancient animistic-polytheistic influences (i.e. Folk Catholicism). Most Visayans are speakers of one or more Visayan languages, the most widely spoken being Cebuano, closely followed by Hiligaynon (Ilonggo) and Waray-Waray. Many have, at some point in their lives, migrated to Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces out of necessity brought about by the negative effects of economic centralization in their nation. They comprise the largest grouping in the geographical division of the country, numbering at around 33 million as of 2010. </p>

<p><i><b>Synopsis Universae Philologiae</b></i> is an early work on comparative linguistics by Gottfried Hensel (<i>Godofredus Henselius</i>, 1687-1767), a rector in Hirschberg (Jelenia Góra), Lower Silesia. Its full title reads:  <i>Synopsis universae philologiae: in qua: miranda unitas et harmonia linguarum totius orbis terrarum occulta, e literarum, syllabarum, vocumque natura &amp; recessibus eruitur. Cum Grammatica, LL. Orient. Harmonica, Synoptice tractata; nec non descriptione Orbis Terr. quoad Linguarum situm &amp; propagationem, mappisque geographico-polyglottis</i>. It was published in 1741 in Nuremberg by commission of the Homann heirs company. A second edition appeared in 1754. </p><p>The book proposes to present all the world's languages known at the time together with their various writing systems. As was common at the time due to the enduring Tower of Babel myth, Hensel attempted to derive all languages from a common origin in Hebrew, following <i>A philosophicall essay for the reunion of the languages, or, the art of knowing all by the mastery of one</i> (1675) by Pierre Besnier (1648–1705).</p>

<p>According to the Constitution of Singapore, the single <b>national language of Singapore</b> is Malay, which plays a symbolic role, as Malays are constitutionally recognized as the indigenous peoples of Singapore, and it is the government's duty to protect their language and heritage. “The national language shall be the Malay language and shall be in the Roman script […]” (Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, PART XIII) Also according to the constitution, the four <b>official languages of Singapore</b> are English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. </p><p>The three languages other than English were chosen to correspond with the major ethnic groups present in Singapore at the time: Mandarin had gained status since the introduction of Chinese-medium schools; Malay was deemed the "most obvious choice" for the Malay community; and Tamil for the largest Indian ethnic group in Singapore, in addition to being "the language with the longest history of education in Malaysia and Singapore". In 2009, more than 20 languages were identified as being spoken in Singapore, reflecting a rich linguistic diversity in the city. Singapore's historical roots as a trading settlement gave rise to an influx of foreign traders, and their languages were slowly embedded in Singapore's modern day linguistic repertoire. </p><p>In the early years, the <i>lingua franca</i> of the island was Bazaar Malay (<i>Melayu Pasar</i>), a creole of Malay and Chinese, the language of trade in the Malay Archipelago. While it continues to be used among many on the island, especially Singaporean Malays, Malay has now been displaced by English. English became the <i>lingua franca</i> due to British rule of Singapore, and was made the main language upon Singaporean independence. Thus, English is the medium of instruction in schools, and is also the main language used in formal settings such as in government departments and the courts. As President Halimah Yacob said during her 2018 speech, “Through the education system, we adopted a common working language in English.” [1] </p><p>Hokkien (Min Nan) briefly emerged as a <i>lingua franca</i> among the Chinese, but by the late 20th century they had been eclipsed by Mandarin. The Government promotes Mandarin among Singaporean Chinese, since it views the language as a bridge between Singapore's diverse non-Mandarin speaking groups, and as a tool for forging a common Chinese cultural identity. China's economic rise in the 21st century has also encouraged a greater use of Mandarin. Other Chinese varieties such as Hokkien, Teochew, Hakka, Hainanese and Cantonese have been classified by the Government as "dialects", and language policies and language attitudes based on this classification and discouragement of usage in Non-Mandarin Chinese or "Chinese dialects" in official settings and television media have led to a decrease in the number of speakers of these varieties. While Tamil is one of Singapore's official languages, other Indian languages are also frequently used.</p><p>Almost all Singaporeans are bilingual since Singapore's bilingual language education policy promotes a dual-language learning system. Learning a second language has been compulsory in primary schools since 1960 and secondary schools since 1966. English is used as the main medium of instruction. On top of this, most children learn one of the three official languages (or, occasionally, another approved language) as a second language, according to their official registered ethnic group. Since 1 January 2011, if a person is of more than one ethnicity and their race is registered in the hyphenated format, the race chosen will be the one that precedes the hyphen in their registered race.</p>

<p><b>PL/0</b> is a programming language, intended as an educational programming language, that is similar to but much simpler than Pascal, a general-purpose programming language. It serves as an example of how to construct a compiler. It was originally introduced in the book, <i>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</i>, by Niklaus Wirth in 1976. It features quite limited language constructs: there are no real numbers, very few basic arithmetic operations and no control-flow constructs other than "if" and "while" blocks. While these limitations make writing real applications in this language impractical, it helps the compiler remain compact and simple. </p>
<p><b>Comorian</b> (<i>Shikomori</i> or <i>Shimasiwa</i>, the "language of islands") is an official language in the Comoros (an independent country of islands in the Indian Ocean, off Mozambique and Madagascar) and widely spoken on the disputed territory of Mayotte, claimed by both France and Comoros. It is part of the Sabaki languages. Each island has a different dialect and the four are conventionally divided into two groups: the eastern group is composed of <i>Shindzuani</i> (spoken on Anjouan) and <i>Shimaore</i> (Mayotte), while the western group is composed of <i>Shimwali</i> (Mohéli) and <i>Shingazija</i> (Grande Comore). Although the two groups share about 80% of their lexicon, they are not usually mutually intelligible, thus suggesting that they should be considered two language groups rather than four dialects.</p><p>Historically, the language was written in the Arabic script. The French colonial administration introduced the Latin script, of which a modified version was officially decreed in 2009. The Arabic script remains widely used. </p><p>It is the language of <i>Udzima wa ya Masiwa,</i> the national anthem. </p>

Phonetic <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i e u o]</span> are a result of palatal and labial assimilation of <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɨ ə/</span> to adjacent consonants. The Ndu languages may take this reduction a step further: In these languages, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɨ/</span> is used as an epenthetic vowel to break up consonant clusters in compound words. Within words, <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɨ/</span> only occurs between similar consonants, and seems to be explicable as epenthesis there as well, so that the only underlying vowels that need to be assumed are <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ə/ and /a/</span>. That is, the Ndu  languages may be a rare case of a two-vowel system, the others being the Arrernte and Northwest Caucasian languages. However, contrasting analyses of these same languages may posit a dozen vowel monophthongs.</p>

<p><b>Embedded SQL</b> is a method of combining the computing power of a programming language and the database manipulation capabilities of SQL. Embedded SQL statements are SQL statements written inline with the program source code , of the host language. The embedded SQL statements are parsed by an embedded SQL preprocessor and replaced by host-language calls to a code library. The output from the preprocessor is then compiled by the host compiler. This allows programmers to embed SQL statements in programs written in any number of languages such as C/C++, COBOL and Fortran. This differs from SQL-derived programming languages that don't go through discrete preprocessors, such as PL/SQL and T-SQL. </p><p>The SQL standards committee defined the embedded SQL standard in two steps: a formalism called <b>Module Language</b> was defined, then the embedded SQL standard was derived from Module Language. The SQL standard defines embedding of SQL as <i>embedded SQL</i> and the language in which SQL queries are embedded is referred to as the <i>host language</i>. A popular host language is C. Host language C and embedded SQL, for example, is called Pro*C in Oracle and Sybase database management systems and ECPG in the PostgreSQL database management system.

Papers have noted that this lack or orthography may endanger the survival of Tai Ya in future generations in Thailand, as the Tai Ya people shift towards the use of Northern Thai and Central Thai, due to the lack of literature in Tai Ya.  However, it has been attested that language vitality as a whole (including the majority speakers in Yunnan Province) is high and "likely to be spoken by future generations".</p>
<p>In sociolinguistics, a <b>style</b> is a set of linguistic variants with specific social meanings. In this context, social meanings can include group membership, personal attributes, or beliefs. Linguistic variation is at the heart of the concept of linguistic style—without variation there is no basis for distinguishing social meanings. Variation can occur syntactically, lexically, and phonologically. </p><p>Many approaches to interpreting and defining style incorporate the concepts of indexicality, indexical order, stance-taking, and linguistic ideology. Note that a style is not a fixed attribute of a speaker. Rather, a speaker may use different styles depending on context. Additionally, speakers often incorporate elements of multiple styles into their speech, either consciously or subconsciously, thereby creating a new style. </p>
<p><b>Ailm</b> is the Irish name of the twentieth letter of the Ogham alphabet, ᚐ. Its phonetic value is [a]. The "Tree Alphabet" glossators identify it with the pine.

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>South African Sign Language</b> (<b>SASL</b>) is the primary sign language spoken by Deaf in South Africa. It is an official language of South Africa.  The South African government added a National Language Unit for South African Sign Language in 2001. SASL is not the only manual language spoken in South Africa, but it is the language that is being promoted as the language to be used by all Deaf in South Africa, although Deaf peoples in South Africa historically do not form a single group. </p><p>In 1995, the previous South African National Council for the Deaf (SANCD) was transformed into the Deaf Federation of South Africa (DeafSA), which resulted in a radical policy change in matters for deaf people in South Africa, such as the development and adoption of a single sign language and the promotion of sign language over oralism.  Schools for the deaf have remained largely untransformed, however, and different schools for deaf children in South African still use different sign language systems, and at a number of schools for the deaf the use of any sign language is either discouraged or simply not taught.  There are as many as twelve distinctly different dialects of sign language in South Africa.</p><p>In addition to South African sign languages, American Sign Language (ASL) is also used by some Deaf people in South Africa.  Most local sign languages in South Africa show the influence of American sign language. </p><p>SASL is the sign language that is used during television news casts in South Africa. Sign language is also used in the South African parliament, but different sign language interpreters are known to use different signs for the same concepts. There are around 40 schools for the Deaf in South Africa, most using a variety of SASL. </p><p>Sign language is explicitly mentioned in the South African constitution, and the South African Schools Act permits the study of the language in lieu of another official language at school.</p><p>By 2011, there were 84 SASL interpreters on DeafSA's interpreter register, including 43 without any training, 31 who have completed 240 study hours of interpreter training, and 10 who have gained an additional 3 years' experience and completed a further 480 study hours.  A total of 7 SASL interpreters have actually been accredited by SATI/DeafSA.  SASL interpreters can apply for accreditation without having completed any formal training in SASL.</p>

<p><b>Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese</b>, <b>Ceylonese Portuguese Creole</b> or <b>Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC)</b> is a language spoken in Sri Lanka. While the predominant languages of the island are Sinhala and Tamil, the interaction of the Portuguese and the Sri Lankans led to the evolution of a new language, Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), which flourished as a <i>lingua franca</i> on the island for over 350 years (16th to mid-19th centuries). SLPC continues to be spoken by an unknown, extremely small population. All speakers of SLPC are members of the Burgher community: descendents of the Portuguese and Dutch who  founded families in Sri Lanka. Europeans, Eurasians and Burghers account for 0.2% of the Sri Lankan population.  Though only a small group of people actually continue to speak SLPC, Portuguese cultural traditions are still in wide practice by many Sri Lankans who are neither of Portuguese descent nor Roman Catholics. SLPC is associated with the Sri Lanka Kaffir people, an ethnic minority group. SLPC has been considered the most important creole dialect in Asia because of its vitality and the influence of its vocabulary on the Sinhalese language. Lexical borrowing from Portuguese can be observed in many areas of the Sinhalese language. Portuguese influence has been so deeply absorbed into daily Sri Lankan life and behavior that these traditions will likely continue into perpetuity.</p>

<p><b>Galician-Asturian</b> or <b>Eonavian</b> (official name by Act 1/1998, March 23 of Principality of Asturias; autonym: <i>eonaviego, gallego-asturiano</i>; Asturian: <i lang="ast">eonaviegu, gallego-asturianu</i>; Galician: <i lang="gl">eonaviego, galego-asturiano</i>) is a set of Romance dialects or <i>falas</i> whose linguistic dominion extends into the zone of Asturias between the Eo River and Navia River (or more specifically the Eo and the Frejulfe River). The dialects have been variously classified as the northeastern varieties of Galician, as a linguistic group of its own, or as a Galician dialect of transition to the Astur-Leonese group.</p><p>The area where the dialects are spoken includes the Asturian municipalities of Boal, Castropol, Coaña, Eilao, El Franco, Grandas de Salime, Pezós, San Martín de Ozcos, Santalla de Ozcos, Santiso de Abres, Tapia de Casariego, Taramundi, A Veiga, Vilanova de Ozcos, and partially those of Navia, Ibias, Villayón, and Allande. </p><p>Other terms used include <i>gallego-asturiano</i>, the official term in Asturias, meaning "Galician-Asturian language", <i>a fala</i> ("the speech", not to be confused with the Fala language of Extremadura) and <i>Galego de Asturias</i> ("Galician language of Asturias"). The term <i>Eonaviego</i> was first used by the linguist Xavier Frías Conde, who translated it as <i>Eonavian</i> in English, <i>Éonavien</i> in French, and <i>Eonavienc</i> in Catalan. In 2007, the Academy of the Asturian Language accepted the term <i>Eonavian</i> to refer to the Galician-Portuguese dialect. </p><p>The set of dialects was traditionally included by linguists as Galician-Portuguese or Galician, with some characteristics of the Astur-Leonese Group. That was the opinion of such linguists as Menéndez Pidal, Eugenio Coseriu, Luís Lindley Cintra, Dámaso Alonso, and more recent ones such as Francisco Xavier Frías Conde and Xoán Babarro. Now, however, there is a political-linguistic conflict on the identity of the language between those who prioritise the mixed identity and those that continue to prioritise the Galician substratum. Supporters of the former, mostly in Asturias, identify Eonavian as a dialect continuum between the Asturian and Galician languages or even a third language belonging to Portuguese-Galician group spoken only in that area (Ruth González Rodríguez, Ricardo Saavedra Fernández-Combarro and Xoxé Miguel Suárez). Supporters of the latter, mostly in Galicia, identify it as Galician and want the same protection as Galician in Castile and Leon, which protects the dialects of El Bierzo in cooperation with the Galician government. </p>

The dialect's territory bears great similarity to that of the <i>Caristii</i> tribe, as described by Roman authors. </p><p>While it is treated as stylish to write in Biscayan and the dialect is still spoken generally in about half of Biscay and some other municipalities, it suffers from the double pressure of Unified Basque and Spanish. </p>  <p>Biscayan was used by Sabino Arana and his early Basque nationalist followers as one of the signs of Basqueness. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p>   <p><b>The Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect</b> is a dialect currently treated both in the contexts of the southeastern group of Bulgarian dialects and the southeastern subgroup of dialects of the Macedonian language. Prior to the codification of Standard Macedonian in 1945, the dialects of Macedonia were classified as Bulgarian. The dialect is dynamic and is well known for the shortening of the words, and also characterised by the excessive use of <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ʲa/</span> for the Proto-Slavic yat even in cases where Standard Bulgarian has <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/ɛ/</span>, a feature which is typical for a number of dialects spoken in southern and southwestern Bulgaria (e.g. the Thracian dialect). The Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect is closely related to the neighbouring dialects. It is closer to all eastern Bulgarian dialects than to all western. The Macedonian language shares much less features with the dialect than it does with the Maleševo-Pirin dialect of Macedonian and Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian dialects are more similar to Macedonian than the Ser-Nevrokop dialect, the Samokov dialect shares more features with Macedonian than both the Ser-Nevrokop and the Pirin-Malasevo dialects do, even though it is not considered a Macedonian dialect, the most of the western Bulgarian dialects and the Smolyan dialect share more similarities with Macedonian than the Ser dialect does. The Samokov dialect, most remarkably, shares with the Macedonian language and the Pirin-Malasevo dialect—the "to be" verb for future tense—"<i>ke</i><span>"</span>, which in contrast is "<i>shte</i><span>"</span> in the Ser-Nevrokop dialect and in the Bulgarian language. The Yat border passes through the Pirin-Malashevo dialect and divides it on such a way that in the northern area of the dialect the yat is pronounced "<i>e</i><span>"</span> (as in all the western Bulgarian dialects and Macedonian) and in the south—"<i>ya</i><span>"</span> (as in the Eastern Bulgarian dialects and standard Bulgarian). In the Ser-Nevrokop dialect the yat is pronounced in most places "<i>ya</i><span>"</span>, therefore the city of Serres, after which the dialect is named, is called "<i>Syar</i><span>"</span> by the locals, as opposed to "<i>Ser</i><span>"</span> in the Macedonian language. As for the first person plural in present tense, in the Ser-Nevrokop dialect the verbs end with the suffix "<i>me</i><span>"</span> always, as in Macedonian, the western and southeastern Bulgarian dialects, as well as in Greek, Czech and Slovak, unlike the standard Bulgarian flexible "<i>me</i><span>"</span> or "<i>m</i><span>"</span> endings, depending on the verb. The first person singular is as in Bulgarian, ending with "<i>a</i><span>"</span> or "<i>am</i><span>"</span> as opposed to the constant "<i>am</i><span>"</span> in Macedonian and the Bulgarian Smolyan dialect. The words for red—"<i>tsrven</i><span>"</span> and for wait—"<i>chekay</i><span>"</span> are shared with the Macedonian language, as opposed to the Bulgarian "<i>chakay</i><span>"</span> and "<i>cherven</i><span>"</span>. The words for man -"<i>m'zh</i><span>"</span> and for a dream "<i>s'n</i><span>"</span> are as in Bulgarian, unlike the Macedonian "<i>mazh</i><span>"</span> and "<i>son</i><span>"</span>. The words for night and tear—"<i>nosht</i><span>"</span> and "<i>s'lza</i><span>"</span> are as the Bulgarian, unlike the Macedonian "<i>nok</i><span>"</span> and "<i>solza</i><span>"</span>.</p>  <p>The Serres-Nevrokop dialect is treated both in the contexts of Bulgarian and Macedonian dialectology. As described in the section about its range, the vast majority of its speakers identify as Bulgarians. In the context of Bulgarian dialectology, the dialect is situated East of the Yat boundary and thus is considered to belong to the Eastern Bulgarian dialects, more exactly to the Rup subgroup</p><p>The previous range of the dialect included vast areas of northeastern Greece, in what is today known as Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. However, considering the mass migration towards Bulgaria in the period from 1912 to 1926, it is unclear to what extent, and if at all, the dialect is preserved in Greece. The only certain region where it is currently spoken is the southeastern quarter of Pirin Macedonia, i.e. in the town of Gotse Delchev and the surrounding municipalities. </p>
<p>The term <b>boundary tone</b> refers to a rise or fall in pitch that occurs in speech at the end of a sentence or other utterance, or, if a sentence is divided into two or more intonational phrases, at the end of each intonational phrase. It can also refer to a low or high intonational tone at the beginning of an utterance or intonational phrase. </p><p>The term was first introduced in a PhD thesis on English intonation by Mark Liberman in 1975 but without being developed further. It was taken up again in 1980 in another PhD thesis on English intonation by Janet Pierrehumbert. In Pierrehumbert's model, which later developed into the ToBI system of intonational transcription, every intonational phrase is marked as ending in a boundary tone, written either H% when the speaker's voice rises up or remains high, or L% when it falls or remains low. </p><p>In modern intonational studies the term 'boundary tone' replaces the notion of 'terminal junctures' (falling #, rising //, and level /) used in earlier American studies of intonation.</p>

<p><b>Frame-based terminology</b> is a cognitive approach to terminology developed by Pamela Faber and colleagues at the University of Granada. One of its basic premises is that the conceptualization of any specialized domain is goal-oriented, and depends to a certain degree on the task to be accomplished. Since a major problem in modeling any domain is the fact that languages can reflect different conceptualizations and construals, texts as well as specialized knowledge resources are used to extract a set of domain concepts. Language structure is also analyzed to obtain an inventory of conceptual relations to structure these concepts. </p><p>As its name implies, frame-based terminology uses certain aspects of frame semantics to structure specialized domains and create non-language-specific representations. Such configurations are the conceptual meaning underlying specialized texts in different languages, and thus facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition. </p><p>Frame-based terminology focuses on: </p> <ol><li>conceptual organization;</li> <li>the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and</li> <li>the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora.</li></ol><p>In frame-based terminology, conceptual networks are based on an underlying domain event, which generates templates for the actions and processes that take place in the specialized field as well as the entities that participate in them. </p><p>As a result, knowledge extraction is largely text-based. The terminological entries are composed of information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network that is capable of adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, Aktionsart distinctions in texts are based on Van Valin's classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the generative lexicon is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities. </p><p>The methodology of frame-based terminology derives the conceptual system of the domain by means of an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach consists of extracting information from a corpus of texts in various languages, specifically related to the domain. The top-down approach includes the information provided by specialized dictionaries and other reference material, complemented by the help of experts in the field.  </p><p>In a parallel way, the underlying conceptual framework of a knowledge-domain event is specified. The most generic or base-level categories of a domain are configured in a prototypical domain event or action-environment interface. This provides a template applicable to all levels of information structuring. In this way a structure is obtained which facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition since the information in term entries is internally as well as externally coherent. </p>

<p>In computer science, particularly in functional programming, <b>hash consing</b> is a technique used to share values that are structurally equal. The term <i>hash consing</i> originates from implementations of Lisp that attempt to reuse cons cells that have been constructed before, avoiding the penalty of memory allocation. Hash consing is most commonly implemented with hash tables storing weak references that may be garbage-collected when the data stored therein contains no references from outside the table. Hash consing has been shown to give dramatic performance improvements—both space and time—for symbolic and dynamic programming algorithms. An interesting property of hash consing is that two structures can be tested for equality in constant time, which in turn can improve efficiency of divide and conquer algorithms when data sets contain overlapping blocks.</p><p>In other communities a similar idea is known as the Flyweight pattern. When applied to strings this technique is also known as <i>string interning</i>. </p>

<p>The <b>Rashad languages</b> form a small language family in the Nuba Hills of Sudan. Part of an erstwhile Kordofanian proposal, they are of uncertain position within the Niger–Congo family. It was at first thought that they shared the characteristic morphology of Niger–Congo, such as the noun-class system. However, only the Tagoi branch has noun classes, and Blench remarks that it appears to have been borrowed. Thus, he classifies Rashad as a divergent branch of Niger–Congo outside the Atlantic–Congo core. A similar situation holds for another Kordofanian family, Katla; these are not closely related to Rashad. </p><p>The number of Rashad languages varies among descriptions, from two (Williamson &amp; Blench 2000, reflected in the ISO codes) to seven (Blench <i>ms,</i> shown here). </p> <ul><li>Tagoi <ul><li>Goy (Tagoi)</li> <li>Umali (Tumale)</li> <li>Moreb</li> <li>Orig (Turjuk)</li></ul></li> <li>Tegali <ul><li>Tegali (Tingal, Kajakja)</li> <li>Gom (Rashad)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>A <b>regular expression</b>, <b>regex</b> or <b>regexp</b> (sometimes called a <b>rational expression</b>) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a <i>search pattern</i>. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. </p><p>The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a <i>regular language</i>. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Since the 1980s, different syntaxes for writing regular expressions exist, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax. </p><p>Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities, built-in or via libraries. </p>

<p><b>Sociophonetics</b> is a branch of linguistics that broadly combines the methods of sociolinguistics and phonetics. It addresses the questions of how socially constructed variation in the sound system is used and learned. The term was first used by Denise Deshaies-Lafontaine in their 1974 dissertation on Quebecois French, with early work in the field focusing on answering chielfy sociolinguistic questions using phonetic methods and data. The field began to expand rapidly in the 1990s: interest in the field increased and the boundaries of the field expanded to include a wider diversity of topics. Currently, sociphonetic studies often employ methods and insight from a wide range of fields including psycholinguistics, clinical linguistics, and computational linguistics.</p>

<p><b>Moses</b> is a free software, statistical machine translation engine that can be used to train statistical models of text translation from a source language to a target language. Moses then allows new source-language text to be decoded using these models to produce automatic translations in the target language. Training requires a parallel corpus of passages in the two languages, typically manually translated sentence pairs. Moses is released under the LGPL licence and available both as source code and binaries for Windows and Linux. Its development is primarily supported by the EuroMatrix project, with funding by the European Commission. </p><p>Among its features are: </p> <ul><li>A beam search algorithm that quickly finds the highest probability translation within a number of choices</li> <li>Phrase-based translation of short text chunks</li> <li>Handles words with multiple factored representations to enable the integration of linguistic and other information (e.g., surface form, lemma and morphology, part-of-speech, word class)</li> <li>Decodes ambiguous forms of a source sentence, represented as a confusion network, to support integration with upstream tools such as speech recognizers</li> <li>Support for large language models (LMs) such as IRSTLM (an exact LM using memory-mapping) and RandLM (an inexact LM based on Bloom filters)</li></ul>

<p><b>Communication access real-time translation (CART)</b>, also called <b>open captioning</b> or <b>real-time stenography</b>, or simply real-time captioning, is the general name of the system that court reporters, closed captioners and voice writers, and others use to convert speech to text.  A trained operator uses keyboard or stenography methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART. </p><p>While real-time speech-to-text serves many with hearing loss and deafness, it is also useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a "transcript', and for learning languages. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers.  </p><p><b>Remote CART</b> is done with the trained operator at a remote location.  A voice connection such as a telephone, cellphone, or computer microphone is used to send the voice to the operator, and the real-time text is transmitted back over a modem, Internet, or other data connection. </p><p>Some people use CART as the short form of computer assisted realtime transcription.  The service is identical. </p><p>In some countries, CART may be referred to as Palantype, Velotype, STTR (speech to text reporting). </p>

Simulink is widely used in automatic control and digital signal processing for multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design.</p>   
<p>A <b>shell script</b> is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup, logging, etc. is called a <b>wrapper</b>. </p><p>The term is also used more generally to mean the automated mode of running an operating system shell; in specific operating systems they are called other things such as batch files (MSDos-Win95 stream, OS/2), command procedures (VMS), and shell scripts (Windows NT stream and third-party derivatives like 4NT—article is at cmd.exe), and mainframe operating systems are associated with a number of terms. </p><p>The typical Unix/Linux/Posix-compliant installation includes the Korn Shell (ksh) in several possible versions such as ksh88, Korn Shell '93 and others. The oldest shell still in common use is the Bourne shell (sh); Unix systems invariably also include the C Shell (csh), Bourne Again Shell (bash), a remote shell (rsh), a secure shell for SSL telnet connections (ssh), and a shell which is a main component of the Tcl/Tk installation usually called tclsh; wish is a GUI-based Tcl/Tk shell. The C and Tcl shells have syntax quite similar to that of said programming languages, and the Korn shells and Bash are developments of the Bourne shell, which is based on the ALGOL language with elements of a number of others added as well. On the other hand, the various shells plus tools like awk, sed, grep, and BASIC, Lisp, C and so forth contributed to the Perl programming language.</p><p>Other shells available on a machine or available for download and/or purchase include ash, msh, ysh, zsh (a particularly common enhanced Korn Shell), the Tenex C Shell (tcsh), a Perl-like shell (psh) and others. Related programs such as shells based on Python, Ruby, C, Java, Perl, Pascal, Rexx &amp;c in various forms are also widely available. Another somewhat common shell is osh, whose manual page states it "is an enhanced, backward-compatible port of the standard command interpreter from Sixth Edition UNIX." </p><p>Windows-Unix interoperability software such as the MKS Toolkit, Cygwin, UWIN, Interix and others make the above shells and Unix programming available on Windows systems, providing functionality all the way down to signals and other inter-process communication, system calls and APIs. The Hamilton C Shell is a Windows shell that is very similar to the Unix C Shell. Microsoft distributes Windows Services for UNIX for use with its NT-based operating systems in particular, which have a Posix environmental subsystem. </p>
<p><b>Duration calculus</b> (<b>DC</b>) is an interval logic for real-time systems. It was originally developed by Zhou Chaochen with the help of Anders P. Ravn and C. A. R. Hoare on the European ESPRIT Basic Research Action (BRA) <i>ProCoS</i> project on <i>Provably Correct Systems</i>.</p><p>DC is mainly useful at the requirements level of the software development process for real-time systems. Some tools are available (e.g., DCVALID, IDLVALID, etc.). Subsets of Duration Calculus have been studied (e.g., using discrete time rather than continuous time). DC is especially espoused by UNU-IIST in Macau and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, which are major centres of excellence for the approach. </p>

<p><b>Vjekoslav (Alojzije) Babukić</b> (July 16, 1812 – December 20, 1875) was a Croatian revivalist and a linguist.</p><p>He was born in Požega. He received a degree in law in 1832 in Zagreb. He was a prominent follower of the Illyrian movement, supporting the programme of cultural unification of South Slavs under Illyrian name. As secretary of the Reading Room (<i>Čitaonica</i>) and <i>Matica ilirska</i> he was connected with prominent individuals in Croatia and other Slavic countries, distributed books and magazines, edited printed editions of older writers (Ivan Gundulić, Andrija Kačić Miošić, Pavao Ritter Vitezović, Junije Palmotić, Ignjat Đurđević, Jerolim Kavanjin) and worked on the establishment of many cultural and scientific institutions. In 1846 he was appointed as the first professor of Croatian language at the Zagreb Royal Academy. Following a reorganization of the educational system he taught in a gymnasium since 1850 until his death.</p><p>He published several treatises on the Illyrian alphabet and orthography, one poem, and minor contributions and translations in <i>Danica ilirska</i> which he also edited and redacted. In 1836 he published in <i>Danica ilirska</i> his <i>Osnova slovnice slavjanske narěčja ilirskoga</i> ("The basics of the Slavic grammar of the Illyrian dialect"), the first Illyrian grammar which served as a linguistic norm for 50 years, and the first Croatian attempt to write a scientific grammar of a language. His second grammar was written in German (<i>Grundzüge der illirischen Sprachlehre</i>), was translated to Italian (<i>Fondamenti della grammatica illirica</i>) and published alongside his <i>Ilirsko-němačko-talianski mali rěčnik</i> ("Illyrian-German-Italian small dictionary") written by Josip Drobnič. This dictionary Babukić also significantly amended up until the letter <i>O</i>, together with Antun Mažuranić.</p><p>The literary language normed in Babukić's grammar is of Neoštokavian dialectal basis, but also with elements from Čakavian and Kajkavian dialects. He advocated the use of etymological (morphophonological) orthography, as opposed to phonological orthography advocated by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and his followers. Babukić abundantly exploited the existing literary traditions in various dialect for the Illyrian cause. As the first grammarian to realize Illyrian language conceptions, critics such as Vatroslav Jagić have called Babukić "The first grammarian of the Illyrian dialect".</p><p>He died in Zagreb. </p>

<p>An endangered language is a language that is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an extinct language.

<p><b>Linguistic typology</b> is a field of linguistics that studies and classifies languages according to their structural and functional features. Its aim is to describe and explain the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages. Its subdisciplines include, but are not limited to: qualitative typology, which deals with the issue of comparing languages and within-language variance; quantitative typology, which deals with the distribution of structural patterns in the world’s languages; theoretical typology, which explains these distributions; syntactic typology, which deals with word order, word form, and word choice; and lexical typology, which deals with language vocabulary. </p>

<p>The <b>Web3D Consortium</b> is an international not-for-profit, member-funded industry consortium, originally founded in 1997. In the Web3D Consortium members from governmental, nonprofit and research organizations worldwide, working alongside individual professional members, collaborate in a consensus process encouraging development and implementation of open standards for 3D content and services.  </p><p>The Web3D Consortium promotes deployment of X3D standards for the communication of 3D scenes in multiple applications, use cases, platforms, and verticals. Members collaboratively develop the X3D standards and tools making them widely adopted across diverse markets for academia, government, industry, and individuals. The Web3D Consortium offers robust ISO standardized 3D functionality and long-term stability for enterprise solutions and interoperability with other 3D standards.  </p><p>The Consortium defines and develops the X3D royalty-free open standards file format and runtime architecture to represent and communicate 3D scenes. The development of 3D web-based graphics has evolved from its beginnings as the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) to Extensible 3D (X3D). Over recent years, advances in real time graphics and networking technology, and most notably the emergence of the Extensible Markup Language XML, have heavily influenced the development of the ISO-approved, freely available, X3D open standard. X3D embodies best practices in commercial real time graphics within the widely adopted framework of the World Wide Web family of technologies and standards and has no intellectual property restrictions. It provides a system for the storage, retrieval and playback of real time graphics content embedded in applications, all within an open architecture to support a wide array of domains and user scenarios. </p><p>Web3D applications have been active for some time. Previously known as the VRML Consortium, this community spearheaded the development of the VRML 1.0 and 2.0 specifications, which provide the basis for the development of associated applications. The organizations involved in this effort felt that the creation of an open consortium focused exclusively on Web3D would provide the structure necessary to stabilize, standardize, and nurture the technology for the entire community. Today, the Web3D Consortium is utilizing its broad-based industry support to develop the X3D specification as a successor to VRML for communicating 3D on the web, between applications and across distributed networks and web services. </p><p>Related to its educational mission, the Consortium maintains an extensive website of documents and links related to VRML and X3D resources, including plugins and browsers from many long term members and open source developers. </p>

<p><b>Partenij Zografski</b> (Bulgarian: <span lang="bg">Партений Зографски</span>; Macedonian: <span lang="mk">Партенија Зографски</span>; 1818 – February 7, 1876) was a 19th-century Bulgarian cleric, philologist, and folklorist from Galičnik in today's Republic of Macedonia, one of the early figures of the Bulgarian National Revival. In his works he referred to his language as <i>Bulgarian</i> and demonstrated a Bulgarian spirit, though besides contributing to the development of the Bulgarian language, in the Republic of Macedonia he is also thought to have contributed to the foundation of the Macedonian language.</p><p>Zografski was born as <b>Pavel Vasilkov Trizlovski</b> (Павел Василков Тризловски) in Galičnik, then in the Ottoman Empire and today in the Republic of Macedonia. He first studied at the Saint Jovan Bigorski Monastery, then he moved to Ohrid in 1836, where he was taught by Bulgarian educator Dimitar Miladinov; he also studied at the Greek schools in Thessaloniki and Istanbul. Trizlovski became a monk at the Bulgarian Zograf Monastery on Mount Athos, where he acquired his clerical name. Zografski continued his education at the seminary in Odessa, Russian Empire; he then joined the Căpriana monastery in Moldova. He graduated from the Kiev seminary in 1846 and from the Moscow seminary in 1850. He was briefly a priest at the Russian church in Istanbul until he established a clerical school at the Zograf Monastery in 1851 and taught there until 1852. From 1852 to 1855, he was a teacher of Church Slavonic at the Halki seminary; from 1855 to 1858, he held the same position at the Bulgarian school in Istanbul, also serving at the Bulgarian and Russian churches in the imperial capital. </p><p>On 29 October 1859, at the request of the Bulgarian Municipality of Kukush (Kilkis), the Patriarchate appointed Zografski Metropolitan of Dojran in order to counter the spread of Eastern Catholicism among the Bulgarians in South Macedonia. Parteniy Zografski co-operated with the locals to establish Bulgarian schools and increase the use of Church Slavonic in liturgy. In 1861, the Greek Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Thessaloniki and a clerical court prosecuted him, but he was acquitted in 1863. In 1867, he was appointed Metropolitan of Nishava in Pirot. At this position, he supported the Bulgarian education in these regions and countered the Serbian propaganda. From 1868 on, Parteniy Zografski broke away from the Patriarchate and joined the independent Bulgarian clergy. After the official establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate he remained a Bulgarian Metropolitan of Pirot until October 1874, when he resigned. </p><p>Besides his religious activity, Zografski was also an active man of letters. He co-operated with the <i>Bulgarian Books</i> magazine and the first Bulgarian newspapers: <i>Savetnik</i>, <i>Tsarigradski Vestnik</i> and Petko Slaveykov's <i>Makedoniya</i>. Zografski advocated the introduction of western Bulgarian elements in the literary Bulgarian language. In 1857, he published a <i>Concise Holy History of the Old and New Testament Church</i>. The following year he published <i>Elementary Education for Children</i>. </p><p>Zografski died in Istanbul on 7 February 1876 and was buried here in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p>The <i><b>Yunjing</b></i> (traditional Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant">韻鏡</span>; simplified Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hans">韵镜</span>; literally: "<i><b>Mirror of Rhymes</b></i>") is one of the two oldest existing examples of a Chinese rhyme table – a series of charts which arrange Chinese characters in large tables according to their tone and syllable structures to indicate their proper pronunciations. Current versions of the <i>Yunjing</i> date to AD 1161 and 1203 editions published by Zhang Linzhi (張麟之).   The original author(s) and date of composition of the <i>Yunjing</i> are unknown.  Some of its elements, such as certain choices in its ordering, reflect features particular to the Tang dynasty, but no conclusive proof of an actual date of composition has yet been found. </p><p>The <i>Yunjing</i> contains 43 tables (Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant">轉</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">zhuǎn</span></i>; literally: "turnings"), each of which tabulates combinations of a particular final rhyme (listed in rows) with various initials (listed in columns), in up to four tones, to show in a grid pattern all possible syllables.  Empty circles on the grid denote that the author(s) were unaware of any word with that particular pronunciation.  By locating a character in <i>Yunjing</i>, a reader could identify its initial consonant (by looking at its column) and its "rhyme", or main vowel and ending consonant (by looking at its row), and combine the two to obtain the word's pronunciation.  Zhang Linzhi's prefaces list a total of 36 possible initial consonants (Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant">聲母</span>; pinyin: <i><span lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">shēngmǔ</span></i>) – by comparison, modern Standard Mandarin only has 23. </p><p>Historical Chinese phonology uses the <i>Yunjing</i> as an accurate representation of Late Middle Chinese (10th – 12th century) phonology.  The <i>Yunjing'</i>s use of this system represents a significant advancement in the Chinese' analysis of their own language, and is believed to have been inspired by their studies of Sanskrit phonological treatises and Buddhist mantras written in the Siddham script during in the Sui and Tang dynasties. </p>
<p>A <b>Chinese vowel diagram</b> or <b>Chinese vowel chart</b> is a schematic arrangement of the vowels of the Chinese language, which usually refers to Standard Chinese. The earliest known Chinese vowel diagrams were made public in 1920 by Chinese linguist Yi Tso-lin with the publication of his <i>Lectures on Chinese Phonetics</i>, three years after Daniel Jones published the famous "cardinal vowel diagram" in 1917. Yi Tso-lin refers to those diagrams as "(simple/compound) rhyme composition charts [單/複韻構成圖]", which are diagrams depicting Chinese monophthongs and diphthongs.  </p><p>Unlike the trapezoidal English vowel diagram (right), the Chinese vowel diagram (left) is triangular. The phonetic symbols used in this diagram are known as the "National Phonetic Alphabet [注音字母]" or "National Phonetic Symbols [注音符號]" or simply "Bopomofo". Six vowels or monophthongs (simple rhyme or 單韻) are depicted in this diagram. They are:  </p> <ul><li>ㄧ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i]</span>), as in ㄧˋ (易, easy)</li> <li>ㄨ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[u]</span>), as in ㄨˋ (霧, fog)</li> <li>ㄦ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɚ]</span>), as in ㄦˋ (二, two)</li> <li>ㄛ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[o]</span>), as in ㄆㄛˋ (破, broken)</li> <li>ㄜ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɤ]</span>), as in ㄜˋ (餓, hungry)</li> <li>ㄚ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[a]</span>), as in ㄆㄚˋ (怕, fear)</li></ul><p>Note that this chart utilizes four degrees of vowel height (closed, half-closed, half-open, open), three degrees of vowel backness (front, central, back), and three degrees of vowel roundedness (spread, natural, round). The placement of ㄦ(<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɚ]</span>) may be questionable, but all other vowels are generally speaking where they ought to be. </p> <p>The same vowel chart is used to depict diphthongs (compound rhyme or 複韻), with an arrow indicating the starting position and ending position of each diphthong. Six falling diphthongs are depicted in the following diagram. They are：  </p> <ul><li>ㄩ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[y]</span>), as in ㄩˋ (玉, jade)</li> <li>ㄝ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɛ]</span>), as in ㄧㄝˋ (夜, night)</li> <li>ㄟ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ei̯]</span>), as in ㄌㄟˋ (累, tired)</li> <li>ㄡ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[oʊ̯]</span>), as in ㄉㄡˋ (豆, bean)</li> <li>ㄞ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ai̯]</span>), as in ㄉㄞˋ (帶, belt)</li> <li>ㄠ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɑʊ̯]</span>), as in ㄉㄠˋ (道, way)</li></ul><p>The reason why apparent monophthongs ㄩ <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[y]</span> and ㄝ <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ɛ]</span> are included in this chart is purely phonological and historical. According to this theory, those two vowels are really diphthongs, i.e. ㄧㄨ <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i̯u]</span> and ㄧㄝ <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i̯ɛ]</span>. Even so, those vowels should be considered "rising diphthongs" on a par with those in the next diagram.  </p><p>The next diagram depicts four rising diphthongs, as follows: </p> <ul><li>ㄧㄛ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i̯o]</span>), as in ㄧㄛˋ (唷, an interjection)</li> <li>ㄨㄛ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[u̯o]</span>), as in ㄨㄛˋ (臥, lie)</li> <li>ㄧㄚ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[i̯a]</span>), as in ㄧㄚˋ (亞, Asia)</li> <li>ㄨㄚ (IPA <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[u̯a]</span>), as in ㄨㄚˋ (襪, socks)</li></ul>

<p><b>Peaceful coexistence</b> (Russian: <span lang="ru">Мирное сосуществование</span>, <small>translit. </small><i lang="ru-Latn" title="Russian-language transliteration">Mirnoye sosushchestvovaniye</i>) was a theory developed and applied by the Soviet Union at various points during the Cold War in the context of primarily Marxist–Leninist foreign policy and was adopted by Soviet-allied socialist states that they could peacefully coexist with the capitalist bloc (i.e., U.S.-allied states). This was in contrast to the antagonistic contradiction principle that socialism and capitalism could never coexist in peace. The Soviet Union applied it to relations between the western world, particularly between the United States and NATO countries and the nations of the Warsaw Pact. </p><p>Debates over differing interpretations of peaceful coexistence were one aspect of the Sino-Soviet split in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the People's Republic of China under the leadership of its founder, Mao Zedong, argued that a belligerent attitude should be maintained towards capitalist countries, and so initially rejected the peaceful coexistence theory as essentially Marxist revisionism. </p><p>However, their decision in 1972 to establish a trade relationship with the United States also saw China cautiously adopting a version of the theory to relations between itself and non-socialist countries. From that point through to the early 1980s and Socialism with Chinese characteristics, China increasingly extended its own peaceful coexistence concept to include all nations. Enver Hoxha also denounced this and turned against China as a result of China growing closer ties to the West such as 1972 Nixon visit to China and today Hoxhaist parties continue to denounce the concept of peaceful coexistence. </p><p>Peaceful coexistence, in extending itself to all countries and social movements tied to the USSR's interpretation of communism, quickly became modus operandi for many individual communist parties as well, encouraging quite a few, especially those in the developed world, to give up their long-term goal of amassing support for an armed, insurrectionist communist revolution and exchange it for more full participation in electoral politics. </p>

<p><b>The Dialect Test</b> was created by A.J. Ellis in February 1879, and was used in the fieldwork for his work <i>On Early English Pronunciation</i>. It stands as one of the earliest methods of identifying vowel sounds and features of speech. The aim was to capture the main vowel sounds of an individual dialect by listening to the reading of a short passage. All the categories of West Saxon words and vowels were included in the test so that comparisons could be made with the historic West Saxon speech as well as with various other dialects. </p> <p>The test consists of seventy-six words, although some of the words are repeated.  The pronunciation of each word or the substitution of another word [for example, many dialects would use "See!" rather than "Look!"] is noted during the test.   In <i>On Early English Pronunciation</i>, A.J. Ellis distinguished forty-two different dialects in England and the Scottish Lowlands. </p><p>In <i>A Grammar of the Dialect of Windhill</i>, Joseph Wright said of Ellis' work, "If his rendering of the dialect test of other dialect speeches is as inaccurate as that of the Windhill dialect, the value of these tests for phonetic and philological purposes is not very great."  Peter Anderson argued that the small differences between Wright's and Ellis's descriptions of the Windhill dialect were likely to be matters of "transcriptional style", as also occurred between different fieldworkers in the Survey of English Dialects.</p><p>The test was used to illustrate different dialects in a series of gramophone records produced by the British Drama League in the early 20th Century. </p>

<p>A <b>reciprocal</b> (abbreviated <b><span><span>RECP</span></span></b>) is a linguistic structure that marks a particular kind of relationship between two noun phrases. In a reciprocal construction, each of the participants occupies both the role of agent and patient with respect to the other. For example, the English sentence <i>"John and Mary cut each other's hair"</i>, contains a reciprocal structure: John cuts Mary's hair, and Mary cuts John's. </p><p>Many languages, such as Semitic languages, Altaic languages or Bantu languages, have special reciprocal morphemes in verbs. English does not, and it generally uses <i>"each other"</i> or some other phrase to indicate reciprocity. Latin uses <i>inter</i> and the reflexive pronoun of the subject of the verb: <i>inter se</i> (between themselves) when the verb is third-person. Most Indo-European languages do not have special markers for reciprocity on verbs, and reciprocal constructions are expressed through reflexivity or other mechanisms.  For example, Russian marks reciprocity in intransitive verbs with the suffix -ся (self), which has also reflexive and passive interpretations. </p>
<p><b>Reyesano</b>, or <b>Chirigua</b> (Chiriba), is a nearly extinct Tacanan language that was spoken by only a few speakers, including children, in 1961 in Bolivia. </p><p>There still are adult speakers in the largely indigenous community of El Cozar in Reyes. However, it is doubtful that this language will survive much into the 21st century. Such is the margination of the indigenous people in the Beni that very little Reyesano words have entered the popular criollo Spanish, very unlike the situation in Quechua and Aymara influenced areas. There are many indigenous terms in  "camba" (Spanish of the Beni) but they mostly of Guaraní origin carried to the Beni by the original settlers from Santa Cruz.</p><p>Evidently the name <i>Reyesano</i> comes from the name of the town of Reyes, of the Province of Ballivián in the Department of the Beni in the plains adjacent to the Bolivian Amazon. The language is also known as Sapiboca (Sapibocona), Maropa, Chumana, and perhaps Warisa (Guariza); these may have corresponded to different dialects. </p>

<p>In automata theory, a <b>deterministic pushdown automaton</b> (<b>DPDA</b> or <b>DPA</b>) is a variation of the pushdown automaton. The class of deterministic pushdown automata accepts the deterministic context-free languages, a proper subset of context-free languages.</p><p>Machine transitions are based on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack.  Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include pushing, popping, or replacing the stack top.  A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton. </p>

<p>A <b>philosophical language</b> is any constructed language that is constructed from first principles, like a logical language, but may entail a strong claim of absolute perfection or transcendent or even mystical truth rather than satisfaction of pragmatic goals. Philosophical languages were popular in Early Modern times, partly motivated by the goal of recovering the lost Adamic or Divine language.  The term <b>ideal language</b> is sometimes used near-synonymously, though more modern philosophical languages such as Toki Pona are less likely to involve such an exalted claim of perfection. It may be known as a language of pure ideology. The axioms and grammars of the languages together differ from commonly spoken languages today.  </p><p>In most older philosophical languages, and some newer ones, words are constructed from a limited set of morphemes that are treated as "elemental" or fundamental. "Philosophical language" is sometimes used synonymously with "taxonomic language", though more recently there have been several conlangs constructed on philosophical principles which are not taxonomic.  Vocabularies of oligosynthetic languages are made of compound words, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of morphemes; oligoisolating languages, such as Toki Pona, similarly use a limited set of root words but produce phrases which remain series of distinct words.  </p><p>Toki Pona is based on minimalistic simplicity, incorporating elements of Taoism. Láadan is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on muted group theory.   </p><p>A priori languages are constructed languages where the vocabulary is invented directly, rather than being derived from other existing languages (as with Esperanto or Ido).  Philosophical languages are almost all a priori languages, but most <i>a priori</i> languages are not philosophical languages.  For example, Quenya, Sindarin, and Klingon are all <i>a priori</i> but not philosophical languages: they are meant to seem like natural languages, even though they have no genetic relation to any natural languages. </p>
<p>In historical linguistics, a <b>macrofamily</b>, also called a <b>superfamily</b> or <b>phylum</b>, is a proposed genetic relationship grouping together language families (also isolates) in a larger scale classification. However, Campbell regards this term as superfluous, preferring "language family" for those classifications for which there is consensus and "<b>distant genetic relationship</b>" for those for which there is no, or not yet, consensus, whether due to lack of documentation or scholarship of the constituent languages, or to an estimated time depth thought by many linguists to be too great for reconstruction.</p><p>More rarely, the term has also been applied to an exceptionally large language family, such as Afro-Asiatic.</p><p>Examples of proposed macro-families range from relatively recent such as Macro-Jê, Macro-Waikurúan, Macro-Mayan, Macro-Siouan, Penutian, Na-Dene or Congo-Saharan (Niger-Saharan) to older ones such as Austric, Dené–Caucasian, Eurasiatic, Nostratic or Ural-Altaic. </p>

<p><b>Q-systems</b> are a method of directed graph transformations according to given grammar rules, developed at the Université de Montréal by Alain Colmerauer in 1967--70 for use in natural language processing. The Université de Montréal's machine translation system, TAUM-73, used the Q-Systems as its language formalism. </p><p>The data structure manipulated by a Q-system is a Q-graph, which is a directed acyclic graph with one entry node and one exit node, where each arc bears a labelled ordered tree. An input sentence is usually represented by a linear Q-graph where each arc bears a word (tree reduced to one node labelled by this word). After analysis, the Q-graph is usually a bundle of 1-arc paths, each arc bearing a possible analysis tree. After generation, the goal is usually to produce as many paths as desired outputs, with again one word per arc.   </p><p>A Q-System consists of a sequence of Q-treatments, each being a set of Q-rules, of the form &lt;matched_path&gt; == &lt;added_path&gt; [&lt;condition&gt;]. The Q-treatments are applied in sequence, unless one of them produces the empty Q-graph, in which case the result is the last Q-graph obtained. The three parts of a rule can contain variables for labels, trees, and forests. All variables after "==" must appear in the &lt;matched_path&gt; part. Variables are local to rules. </p><p>A Q-treatment works in two steps, addition and cleaning. It first applies all its rules exhaustively, using instantiation (one-way unification), thereby adding new paths to the current Q-graph (added arcs and their trees can be used to produce new paths). If and when this addition process halts, all arcs used in some successful rule application are erased, as well as all unused arcs that are no more on any path from the entry node to the exit node. Hence, the result, if any (if the addition step terminates), is again a Q-graph. That allows several Q-Systems to be chained, each of them performing a specialized task, together forming a complex system. For example, TAUM 73 consisted of fifteen chained Q-Systems. </p><p>An extension of the basic idea of the Q-Systems, namely to replace instantiation by unification (to put it simply, allow "new" variables in the right hand side part of a rule, and replace parametrized labelled trees by logical terms) led to Prolog, designed by Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel in 1972. Refinements in the other direction (reducing non-determinism and introducing typed labels) by John Chandioux led to GramR, used for programming METEO from 1985 onward. </p><p>In 2009, Hong Thai Nguyen of GETALP GETALP, LIG (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble) reimplemented the Q-language in C, using ANTLR to compile the Q-systems and the Q-graphs, and an algorithm proposed by Christian Boitet (as none had been published and sources of the previous Fortran implementation had been lost). That implementation was corrected, completed and extended (to labels using Unicode characters and not only the printable characters of the CDC6600 of the historical version) by David Cattanéo in 2010-11. </p>

<p><b>Compensatory lengthening</b> in phonology and historical linguistics is the lengthening of a vowel sound that happens upon the loss of a following consonant, usually in the syllable coda, or of a vowel in an adjacent syllable. Lengthening triggered by consonant loss may be considered an extreme form of fusion (Crowley 1997:46). Both types may arise from speakers' attempts to preserve a word's moraic count.</p>

Also, minor Danish-speaking communities are found in Norway, Sweden, Spain, the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. Due to immigration and language shift in urban areas, around 15–20% of the population of Greenland speak Danish as their first language. </p><p>Along with the other North Germanic languages, Danish is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Era. Danish, together with Swedish, derives from the East Norse dialect group, while the Middle Norwegian language before the influence of Danish and Norwegian Bokmål are classified as West Norse along with Faroese and Icelandic. A more recent classification based on mutual intelligibility separates modern spoken Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish as "mainland Scandinavian", while Icelandic and Faroese are classified as "insular Scandinavian". Danish has close similarities to the two main Germanic languages of German and English, but is not mutually intelligible with either. </p><p>Until the 16th century, Danish was a continuum of dialects spoken from Schleswig to Scania with no standard variety or spelling conventions. With the Protestant Reformation and the introduction of printing, a standard language was developed which was based on the educated Copenhagen dialect. It spread through use in the education system and administration, though German and Latin continued to be the most important written languages well into the 17th century. Following the loss of territory to Germany and Sweden, a nationalist movement adopted the language as a token of Danish identity, and the language experienced a strong surge in use and popularity, with major works of literature produced in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, traditional Danish dialects have all but disappeared, though regional variants of the standard language exist. The main differences in language are between generations, with youth language being particularly innovative. </p><p>Danish has a very large vowel inventory comprising 27 phonemically distinctive vowels, and its prosody is characterized by the distinctive phenomenon <i>stød</i>, a kind of laryngeal phonation type. Due to the many pronunciation differences that set apart Danish from its neighboring languages, particularly the vowels, difficult prosody and "weakly" pronounced consonants, it is sometimes considered to be a difficult language to learn and understand, and some evidence shows that small children are slower to acquire the phonological distinctions of Danish. The grammar is moderately inflective with strong (irregular) and weak (regular) conjugations and inflections. Nouns and demonstrative pronouns distinguish common and neutral gender. Like English, Danish only has remnants of a former case system, particularly in the pronouns. Unlike English, it has lost all person marking on verbs. Its syntax is V2 word order, with the finite verb always occupying the second slot in the sentence. </p>

<p><b>BabelNet</b> is a multilingual lexicalized semantic network and ontology developed at the Sapienza University of Rome, at  the Department of Computer Science Linguistic Computing Laboratory. BabelNet was automatically created by linking Wikipedia to the most popular computational lexicon of the English language, WordNet. The integration is done using an automatic mapping and by filling in lexical gaps in resource-poor languages by using statistical machine translation. The result is an "encyclopedic dictionary" that provides concepts and named entities lexicalized in many languages and connected with large amounts of semantic relations. Additional lexicalizations and definitions are added by linking to free-license wordnets, OmegaWiki, the English Wiktionary, Wikidata, FrameNet, VerbNet and others. Similarly to WordNet, BabelNet groups words in different languages into sets of synonyms, called <i>Babel synsets</i>. For each Babel synset, BabelNet provides short definitions (called glosses) in many languages harvested from both WordNet and Wikipedia. </p>

Guaraní is the home language of more than half the population of Paraguay, with higher proportions of its use in rural areas, and those who speak Spanish at home slightly in the majority in the cities.</p><p>The Swedish linguist Bertil Malmberg visited Paraguay in 1946 and observed several features of Spanish pronunciation that he attributed to Guaraní influence. The Guaraní origin of many of these features, however, has been questioned  by other researchers, who document them in dialects not in contact with Guaraní.</p>

This same process can be used, applying the last two rules in different orders in order to get all possible strings within our simple context-free grammar. </p><p>Languages generated by context-free grammars are known as context-free languages (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The language equality question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is undecidable. </p><p>Context-free grammars arise in linguistics where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were in fact invented by the linguist Noam Chomsky for this purpose, but have not really lived up to their original expectation. By contrast, in computer science, as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) called the <i>Document Type Definition</i>.</p><p>In linguistics, some authors use the term <b>phrase structure grammar</b> to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from dependency grammars. In computer science, a popular notation for context-free grammars is Backus–Naur form, or <i>BNF</i>. </p>

It is formed by the confluence of the Dadès River and Imini River. It flows from the High Atlas mountains, initially south-eastward to Tagounite, and from Tagounite mostly westwards to its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean somewhat north of Tan-Tan. Most of the year the part of the Draa after Tagounite falls dry. </p><p>The water from the Draa is used to irrigate palm groves and small horticulture along the river. The inhabitants of the Draa are called in Arabic <i>Drawa</i>, in Shilha <i>Idrawiyn</i>, the most famous Drawi (singular of Drawa) undoubtedly being Sultan Mohammed ash-Sheikh (1490–1557). Outside of the Draa region this name is mostly used to refer to the dark skinned people of Draa, which make up the largest portion of its inhabitants. </p><p>In the first half of the 20th century, the lowest course of the Draa marked the boundary between the French protectorate of Morocco and the area under Spanish rule. </p><p>About 225,000 people live in the valley of the Draa, which measures 23,000 square kilometres (8,900 sq mi). The valley corresponds with the province of Zagora, created in 1997, in the Souss-Massa-Drâa region. In the province there are 23 villages and two towns: Zagora and Agdz. The village of Tamegroute, near Zagora, is well known for its Zawiya. </p><p>The valley contains the Fezouata formations, which are Burgess shale-type deposits dating to the Lower Ordovician, filling an important preservational window between the common Cambrian lagerstätten and the Late Ordovician Soom shale. In the fossilized fauna were numerous organisms previously thought to have died out after the mid-Cambrian.</p>

The distinction made by the translocative is similar to the distinction made in "I went <i>and</i> bought things". </p>

<p>In computing, <b>Chinese character encodings</b> can be used to represent text written in the CJK languages — Chinese, Japanese, Korean — and (rarely) obsolete Vietnamese, all of which use Chinese characters. Several general-purpose character encodings accommodate Chinese characters, and some of them were developed specifically for Chinese. </p><p>In addition to Unicode (with the set of CJK Unified Ideographs), local encoding systems exist. The Chinese Guobiao (or GB, "national standard") system used in Mainland China and Singapore, and the (mainly) Taiwanese Big5 system used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau are two primary "legacy" local encoding systems. Guobiao is usually displayed using simplified characters and Big5 is usually displayed using traditional characters. There is however no mandated connection between the encoding system and the font used to display the characters; font and encoding are usually tied together for practical reasons. </p><p>The issue of which encoding to use can also have political implications, as GB is the official standard of the People's Republic of China and Big5 is a <i>de facto</i> standard of Taiwan. </p><p>In contrast to the situation with Japanese, there has been relatively little overt opposition to Unicode, which solves many of the issues involved with GB and Big5.  Unicode is widely regarded as politically neutral, has good support for both simplified and traditional characters, and can be easily converted to and from the GB and Big5.  Furthermore, Unicode has the advantage of not being limited only to Chinese, since it can also display many other character sets. </p>

<p>A <b>specification language</b> is a formal language in computer science used during systems analysis, requirements analysis and systems design to describe a system at a much higher level than a programming language, which is used to produce the executable code for a system. </p><p>Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the <i>what</i>, not the <i>how</i>. Indeed, it is considered as an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail. </p><p>A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as algebraic or model-theoretic structures that include a collection of sets of data values together with functions over those sets.  This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties. </p><p>In the <i>property-oriented</i> approach to specification (taken e.g. by CASL), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical axioms, usually in a logical system in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy - often just by their interrelationship. This is in contrast to so-called model-oriented specification in frameworks like VDM and Z, which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour. </p><p>Specifications must be subject to a process of <i>refinement</i> (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, Hartmann pipelines, when properly applied, may be considered a dataflow specification which <i>is</i> directly executable.  Another example is the Actor model which has no specific application content and must be <i>specialized</i> to be executable. </p><p>An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of proofs of program correctness (<i>see theorem prover</i>). </p>
<p><b>The</b> <b>Sabanê</b> language is one of the three major groups of languages spoken in the Nambikwara family.

<p>In linguistics, <b>branching</b> refers to the shape of the parse trees that represent the structure of sentences. Assuming that the language is being written or transcribed from left to right, parse trees that grow down and to the right are <i>right-branching</i>, and parse trees that grow down and to the left are <i>left-branching</i>. The direction of branching reflects the position of heads in phrases, and in this regard, right-branching structures are <i>head-initial</i>, whereas left-branching structures are <i>head-final</i>. English has both right-branching (head-initial) and left-branching (head-final) structures, although it is more right-branching than left-branching. Some languages such as Japanese and Turkish are almost fully left-branching (head-final). Some languages are mostly right-branching (head-initial). </p>

<p>In the fictional universe of J. R. R. Tolkien, many of the Elves undertook a great migration and built a city upon reaching their destination; in early versions of the mythology, this city was known as Kôr.  All those Elves who did not undertake the migration, and consequently did not see Kôr, were known by the Quenya term <b>Ilkorindi</b>, literally "not of Kôr".  The same term was applied to their many languages. </p><p>Reworking the mythology in the late 1920s, Tolkien applied the word only to those Elves (later called Sindar) who lived in Beleriand and were ruled by King Thingol: </p><p>"In the course of ages the tongues and dialects of Beleriand became altogether estranged from those of other Eldar in Valinor, through the learned in such lore may perceive that they were anciently sprung from Telerin. These were the <b>Ilkorin</b> speeches of Beleriand."</p><p>These Ilkorin Elves spoke three dialects:  </p> <ul><li>the speech of the Elves of the Kingdom of Doriath, <i>Doriathrin</i>;</li> <li>the speech of the Elves from the havens of Brithombar and Eglarest, <i>Falassian</i>;</li> <li>the speech of the nomadic Elves living in Beleriand.</li></ul><p>Later on (in the early 1940s) Tolkien conceived the name <i>Lemberin</i> for that language, and said about <i>Ilkorin</i> that it "is not rightly a linguistic name, and included the <i>Pereldar</i>, and all who began the march, but did not come to Kór".</p><p>So Lemberin became the name for the tongue of the Telerin Elves that remained in Beleriand. Before the coming of the Noldor it was spoken far and wide in Beleriand (save in Ossiriand) and all the names of places, of rivers, woods, fields, plains, hills and mountains were given in this tongue. </p>

<p><b>Filippo Sassetti</b> (1540–1588) was a traveller and merchant from a long-established Florentine mercantile family, who was born in Florence in 1540. Though his father had sold family interests and he had to commence as a clerk in a merchant business, Sassetti enrolled in 1568 at the University of Pisa and was imbued with a humanist education; he was proficient in botany, geography, astronomy and cosmography and was curious about philology and the classical languages. </p><p>Settling in Lisbon in 1578-82, he travelled to the Indian subcontinent, reaching Cochin in November 1583, and remained in Cochin and Goa and the Malabar coast that joins the two, until his death. He is known to posterity from the thirty-two detailed letters he sent home to members of the Florentine patriciate and the Grand Duke of Tuscany; they were not published until centuries after his death. Sassetti, an attentive observer of people and customs, was among the first European observers to study the ancient Indian language, Sanskrit. Writing privately to fellow Florentine Bernardo Davanzati in 1585, he noted some word similarities between Sanskrit and Italian (e.g. <i>deva/dio</i> 'God', <i>sarpa/serpe</i> 'snake', <i>sapta/sette</i> 'seven', <i>ashta/otto</i> 'eight', <i>nava/nove</i> 'nine'). This unpublished observation is today credited to have foreshadowed the later discovery of the Indo-European language family. Sassetti died in Goa, India in 1588. </p>

<p>A <b>revived language</b> is one that, having experienced near or complete extinction as either a spoken or written language, has been intentionally revived and has regained some of its former status.</p><p>The most frequent reason for extinction is the marginalisation of local languages within a wider dominant nation state, which might at times amount to outright political oppression. This process normally works alongside economic and cultural pressures for greater centralisation and assimilation. Once a language has become marginalised in this way, it is often perceived as being "useless" by its remaining speakers, who associate it with low social status and poverty, and consequently fail to pass it on to the next generation.  </p><p>The only substantial success story in the field of language revival is Hebrew; all other cases are projects of limited success. </p>

Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree. Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German.</p><p>The Czech–Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech–Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak. </p><p>Czech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants (divided into "hard", "neutral" and "soft" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language, represented by the grapheme <i>ř</i>. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model. </p>

<p><b>Zipf's law</b> (<span></span>) is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions.  <i>Zipf distribution</i> is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical. </p><p>For example, Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word <i>the</i> is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word <i>of</i> accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by <i>and</i> (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.</p><p>The law is named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it. The French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf. It was also noted in 1913 by German physicist Felix Auerbach (1856–1933). </p>

<p><b>Malecite–Passamaquoddy</b> (also known as Maliseet–Passamaquoddy) is an endangered Algonquian language spoken by the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy peoples along both sides of the border between Maine in the United States and New Brunswick, Canada. The language consists of two major dialects: Malecite, which is mainly spoken in the Saint John River Valley in New Brunswick; and Passamaquoddy, spoken mostly in the St. Croix River Valley of eastern Maine. However, the two dialects differ only slightly, mainly in accent. Malecite-Passamaquoddy was widely spoken by the indigenous people in these areas until around the post-World War II era, when changes in the education system and increased marriage outside of the speech community caused a large decrease in the number of children who learned or regularly used the language. As a result, in both Canada and the U.S. today, there are only 600 speakers of both dialects, and most speakers are older adults. Although the majority of younger people cannot speak the language (particularly the Passamaquoddy dialect), there is growing interest in teaching the language in community classes and in some schools.</p>
<p><b>Mirza Melkum Khan</b> (1834-1908), also spelled as <i>Malkom Khan</i>, was a prominent Iranian modernist, preoccupied with the transformation of Iran into a modern state. The most remarkable aspect of his work was his promotion of 'law', to bring about an orderly society in which royal power was subjected or 'conditioned' (<i>mashrut</i>) to checks and regulations. He developed these ideas in a number of works, but most importantly in his newspaper <i>Qanun</i> (Law), which had a wide readership among Iran's modernists. As such, he can be considered one of the fathers of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution.  </p>
<p>The <b>kingdom of the Ait Abbas</b> or <b>sultanate of the Beni Abbas</b>, in (Berber (phonetic) tagelda n At Ɛebbas, ⵜⴰⴳⴻⵍⴷⴰ ⵏ ⴰⵜ ⵄⴻⴱⴱⴰⵙ; Arabic: salṭanat Beni Ɛabbas, سلطنة بني عباس), is a former berber state of North Africa, then a fief and a principality, controlling Lesser Kabylie and its surroundings from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. It is referred to in the Spanish historiography as "reino de Labes"; sometimes more commonly referred to by its ruling family, the Mokrani, in Berber <i>At Muqran</i>, in Arabic <i>أولاد مقران (Ouled Moqrane)</i>. Its capital was the Kalâa of Ait Abbas, an impregnable citadel in the Biban mountain range. </p><p>Founded by last Hafsid dynasty emirs of Bejaia, the kingdom was for a long time a bastion of resistance to the Spaniards, then to the regency of Algiers. Strategically located on the road from Algiers to Constantine and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Sahara, its capital Kalâa of Ait Abbas attracted Andalusians, Christians and Jews in the sixteenth century, fleeing Spain or Algiers. Their know-how enriched a local industrial fabric whose legacy is the handicraft of the Ait Abbas tribe. The surrounding tribes were also home to intense intellectual activity and a literary tradition that rivalled those of other Maghreb cities. </p><p>At its peak, the influence of the kingdom of Ait Abbas extended from the valley of the Soummam to the Sahara and its capital the Kalâa rivalled the biggest cities. In the seventeenth century, its chiefs took the title of <i>sheikh of the Medjana</i>, but were still described as sultans or kings of the Beni Abbés. At the end of the eighteenth century, the kingdom led by the Mokrani family (Amokrane) broke up into several clans, some of which became vassals of the regency of Algiers. However, the Sheikh of the Medjana maintained himself at the head of his principality as a tributary of the Bey of Constantine, managing his affairs independently. </p><p>With the arrival of the French, some Mokrani took the side of the colonisers, while others sided with the resistance. The French, to strengthen their hold in the region, relied on the local lords, maintaining an appearance of autonomy of the region under its traditional leaders until 1871. Its sovereigns assumed various titles, successively sultan, <i>amokrane</i>  and sheikh of the Medjana. Temporarily integrated into the French military administration before the revolt of 1871, they were known as khalifa and bachagha. The defeat of 1871 marked the end of the political role of the Mokrani with the surrender of the Kalâa to the French. </p>

Disfranchisement was a means of repression of the categories of population that were classified as "enemies of the working people".</p><p>The 1918 Soviet Constitution enumerated the categories of disenfranchised people: </p> <ul><li>Persons who used hired labor to obtain increase in profits</li> <li>Persons who have income without doing any work, such as interests from capital, receipts from property, etc.</li> <li>Private merchants, trade and commercial brokers</li> <li>Monks and clergy of all denominations</li> <li>Persons who were policemen or military officers before Soviet Revolution</li> <li>Persons who have been declared demented or mentally deficient, persons under guardianship, etc.</li></ul><p>The 1924 Soviet Constitution and subsequent decrees detailed this list further and added new categories. Being disenfranchised meant much more than simply being disallowed to vote or be elected. A <i>lishenets</i> could not occupy any governmental position, or receive higher and technical education. S/he was deprived of various privileges and subsidies: employment, housing, retirement, etc.  S/he could not be a member of kolkhozes and other kinds of cooperatives. </p><p>During the rationing system of 1929-1930, disenfranchised persons were also deprived of rations.</p><p>Members of the family whose head  was <i>lishenets</i> were automatically disenfranchised. The voting rights could be restored by local election commissions upon the proof of engagement in productive labor and of the loyalty to the Soviet power. The ultimate authorities were the Central Election Commission and Presidium of the Central Executive Committee. </p><p>The 1936 Soviet Constitution instituted universal suffrage, and the category of <i>lishenets</i> was officially eliminated. Nevertheless, for a long time after 1936, Soviet citizens applying for any job had to make a statement if they or their family members were ever deprived of voting rights so they still fell into a disenfranchised category.</p>

<p>The <b>Urartian</b> or <b>Vannic</b> language was spoken by the inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of Urartu, located in the region of Lake Van, with its capital near the site of the modern town of Van, in the Armenian Highland, modern-day Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. It was probably dominant around Lake Van and in the areas along the upper Zab valley.</p><p>First attested in the 9th century BCE, Urartian ceased to be written after the fall of the Urartian state in 585 BCE, and presumably it became extinct due to the fall of Urartu.

<p>In linguistics, a <b>register</b> is a variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting. For example, when speaking in a formal setting, an English speaker may be more likely to use features of prescribed grammar than in an informal setting—such as pronouncing words ending in <i>-ing</i> with a velar nasal instead of an alveolar nasal (e.g. "walking", not "walkin'"), choosing more formal words (e.g. <i>father</i> vs. <i>dad,</i> <i>child</i> vs. <i>kid,</i> etc.), and refraining from using words considered nonstandard, such as <i>ain't</i>. </p><p>As with other types of language variation, there tends to be a spectrum of registers rather than a discrete set of obviously distinct varieties—numerous registers could be identified, with no clear boundaries between them. Discourse categorisation is a complex problem, and even in the general definition of "register" given above (language variation defined by use not user), there are cases where other kinds of language variation, such as regional or age dialect, overlap. Consequent to this complexity, scholarly consensus has not been reached for the definitions of terms including "register", "field" or "tenor"; different scholars' definitions of these terms are often in direct contradiction of each other. Additional terms including diatype, genre, text types, style, acrolect, mesolect, basilect, sociolect and ethnolect among many others, may be used to cover the same or similar ground. Some prefer to restrict the domain of the term "register" to a specific vocabulary (Wardhaugh, 1986) (which one might commonly call slang, jargon, argot or cant), while others argue against the use of the term altogether. These various approaches with their own "register", or set of terms and meanings, fall under disciplines including sociolinguistics, stylistics, pragmatics or systemic functional grammar. </p>

<p>The Tlingit language has been recorded in a number of orthographies over the two hundred years since European contact. The first transcriptions of Tlingit were done by Russian Orthodox ministers, hence they were in the Cyrillic script. A hiatus in writing Tlingit occurred subsequent to the purchase of Alaska by the United States due to the policies implemented by Presbyterian reverend and territorial educational commissioner Sheldon Jackson, who believed that the use of indigenous languages should be suppressed in favor of English. American and German anthropologists began recording Tlingit in various linguistic transcriptions from the 1890s onward, and there exists a small body of literature and a large amount of vocabulary recorded in these transcriptions. With the work of two linguists from the Summer Institute of Linguistics, Gillian Story and Constance Naish, the first “complete” orthography for Tlingit began to spread in the 1960s. This orthography, now somewhat modified by native hands, is the most common orthography in use today. In the 1980s Jeff Leer and the Yukon Native Language Center developed another orthography for writing Interior Tlingit. Since the spread of e-mail among the Tlingit population a new orthography has developed by consensus, based on the Naish-Story orthography but adapted to the restrictions of plain text encodings such as ISO 8859-1. </p>

<p><b>Watson Kirkconnell</b>,  (16 May 1895 – 26 February 1977) was a Canadian scholar, university administrator and translator. He is well known in Iceland, Eastern and Central Europe and among Canadians of different origins for his translations of national poetry, particularly from Hungarian, Ukrainian, Russian and Serbo-Croatian.  He collaborated with distinguished scholars and academics of his time in perfecting the translations, including literary critic Pavle Popović. One of his most remarkable translations is The Bards of Wales, a poem of Hungarian poet János Arany. </p><p>After World War II, Kirkconnell wrote a poem about Draža Mihailović, alleging that the Serb general's execution on July 17, 1946 at the hands of Josip Broz Tito's victorious Yugoslav Partisans had followed a show trial and that charges of terrorist war crimes against civilians and of Chetnik collaboration with occupying Italian and German Axis forces had been trumped up. The execution solidified Communist rule in Yugoslavia for the next four decades, before the federal state ultimately disintegrated into civil war after Tito's death, when latent internal tensions were no longer being suppressed.  </p><p>From 1948 to 1964, he was the ninth President of Acadia University. He was also on numerous occasions shortlisted for the prestigious Nobel Prize.</p><p>In 1968, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada "for his services at home and abroad as an educator, scholar and writer".

His teachings had a strong influence on the states of Western Europe, most immediately in the approval of a reformed Bohemian religious denomination, and, more than a century later, on Martin Luther himself. He was burned at the stake for heresy against the doctrines of the Catholic Church, including those on ecclesiology, the Eucharist, and other theological topics. </p><p>After Hus was executed in 1415, the followers of his religious teachings (known as Hussites) rebelled against their Catholic rulers and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. Both the Bohemian and the Moravian populations remained majority Hussite until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the Battle of the White Mountain resulted in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown coming under Habsburg dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion in an intense campaign of return to Catholicism. </p>

<p>The <b>Lower Mamberamo languages</b> are a recently proposed language family linking two languages spoken along the northern coast of Papua province, Indonesia, near the mouth of the Mamberamo River. </p><p>The two languages, Warembori and Yoke, were listed as isolates in Stephen Wurm's widely used classification.  Donohue (1998) showed them to be related with shared morphological irregularities. Ross (2007) classified Warembori as an Austronesian language based on pronouns; however, Donohue argues that these are borrowed, since the two pronouns most resistant to borrowing, 'I' and 'thou', do not resemble Austronesian or any other language family. The singular prefixes resemble Kwerba languages, but Lower Mamberamo has nothing else in common with that family. (See Warembori language and Yoke language for details.) Donohue argues that they form an independent family, though one perhaps related to another Papuan family, that has been extensively relexified under Austronesian influence, especially in the case of Warembori. </p>

<p>In formal language theory, a string is defined as a finite sequence of members of an underlying base set; this set is called the <b>alphabet</b> of a string or collection of strings. The members of the set are called <i>symbols</i>, and are typically thought of as representing letters, characters, or digits.

<p class="mw-empty-elt"> </p> <p><b>Dic Aberdaron</b> (<b>Richard Robert Jones</b>) (1780–1843), also known as Dick of Aberdaron, was a Welsh traveller and polyglot.

William Roscoe, the writer, wrote a <i>Memoir</i> of him and the Welsh poet R. S. Thomas, who was once the vicar of Aberdaron, wrote a poem about him, simply titled <i>Dic Aberdaron</i>.  T.H. Parry Williams wrote a somewhat different poem with the same title in Welsh, stressing his eccentricity and the pointlessness of his learning, since he never appears to have used any of his languages, but concludes: "Chwarae-teg i Dic - nid yw pawb yn gwirioni'r un fath" (Fair play to Dic - not everybody is silly in the same way).  </p>
<p> Machine translation is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one natural language to another. </p><p>In the 1950s, machine translation became a reality in research, although references to the subject can be found as early as the 17th century (Machine translation). The Georgetown experiment, which involved successful fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English in 1954, was one of the earliest recorded projects. Researchers of the Georgetown experiment asserted their belief that machine translation would be a solved problem within three to five years. In the Soviet Union, similar experiments were performed shortly after.  Consequently, the success of the experiment ushered in an era of significant funding for machine translation research in the United States. The achieved progress was much slower than expected; in 1966, the ALPAC report found that ten years of research had not fulfilled the expectations of the Georgetown experiment and resulted in dramatically reduced funding. </p><p>Interest grew in statistical models for machine translation, which became more common and also less expensive in the 1980s as available computational power increased. </p><p>Although there exists no autonomous system of "fully automatic high quality translation of unrestricted text," there are many programs now available that are capable of providing useful output within strict constraints. Several of these programs are available online, such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers AltaVista's BabelFish (now Yahoo's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008). </p>

The total surface is 94,250 square miles (244,106 km<sup>2</sup>), and the total volume (measured at the low water datum) is 5,439 cubic miles (22,671 km<sup>3</sup>), slightly less than the volume of Lake Baikal (23,615 km³, 22–23% of the world's surface fresh water). Due to their sea-like characteristics (rolling waves, sustained winds, strong currents, great depths, and distant horizons) the five Great Lakes have also long been referred to as <i>inland seas</i>. Lake Superior is the second largest lake in the world by area, and the largest freshwater lake by area. Lake Michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country.</p><p>The Great Lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago, as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater.

<p><b>Cognitive linguistics</b> (<b>CL</b>) is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics. It describes how language interacts with cognition, how language forms our thoughts, and the evolution of language parallel with the change in the common mindset across time.</p><p>According to Merriam-Webster, the word "cognitive" is defined as "of, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity (such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering)". Merriam-Webster also defines linguistics as "the study of human speech including the units, nature, structure, and modification of language". Combining those two definitions together to form cognitive linguistics would provide the notion of the concepts and ideas discussed in the realm of CL. Within CL, the analysis of the conceptual and experiential basis of linguistic categories is of primary importance. The formal structures of language are studied not as if they were autonomous, but as reflections of general conceptual organization, categorization principles, processing mechanisms, and experiential and environmental influences. </p><p>Since cognitive linguistics sees language as embedded in the overall cognitive capacities of human beings, topics of special interest for cognitive linguistics include: the structural characteristics of natural language categorization (such as prototypicality, systematic polysemy, cognitive models, mental imagery, and conceptual metaphor); the functional principles of linguistic organization (such as iconicity and naturalness); the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics (as explored by cognitive grammar and construction grammar); the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in-use; and the relationship between language and thought, including questions about linguistic relativity and conceptual universals. </p><p>What holds together the diverse forms of cognitive linguistics is the belief that linguistic knowledge involves not just knowledge of the language, but knowledge of the world as mediated by the language. In addition, cognitive linguistics argues that language is both embodied and situated in a specific environment. </p>
<p>The <b>Central Algonquian languages</b> are commonly grouped together as a subgroup of the larger Algonquian family, itself a member of the Algic family. Though the grouping is often encountered in the literature, it is an areal grouping, not a genetic grouping. In other words, the languages are grouped together because they were spoken near one another, not because they are more closely related to one another than to other Algonquian languages. Within the Algonquian family, only Eastern Algonquian is a valid genealogical group. </p><p>Within the Central Algonquian grouping, Potawatomi and Chippewa, otherwise known as Ojibwe, are closely related and are generally grouped together as an Ojibwa-Potawatomi sub-branch. David J. Costa speculated in his 2003–2004 web publications that Central Algonquian has a specific language sub-branch that he refers to as "Eastern Great Lakes". The hypothesis for the subgroup is based on lexical and phonological innovations. </p>
<p>The <b>Germanic languages</b> are a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by a population of about 515 million people mainly in Europe, North America, Oceania, and Southern Africa.  </p><p>The West Germanic languages include the three most widely spoken Germanic languages: English with around 360-400 million native speakers; German, with over 100 million native speakers; and Dutch, with 23 million native speakers. Other West Germanic languages include Afrikaans, an offshoot of Dutch, with over 7.1 million native speakers; Low German, considered a separate collection of unstandardized dialects, with roughly 0.3 million native speakers and probably 6.7-10 million people who can understand it (at least 5 million in Germany and 1.7 million in the Netherlands); Yiddish, once used by approximately 13 million Jews in pre-World War II Europe and Scots, both with 1.5 million native speakers; Limburgish varieties with roughly 1.3 million speakers along the Dutch–Belgian–German border; and the Frisian languages with over 0.5 million native speakers in the Netherlands and Germany. </p><p>The main North Germanic languages are  Danish, Faroese, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish, which have a combined total of about 20 million speakers. </p><p>The East Germanic branch included Gothic, Burgundian, and Vandalic, all of which are now extinct. The last to die off was Crimean Gothic, spoken until the late 18th century in some isolated areas of Crimea.</p><p>The SIL <i>Ethnologue</i> lists 48 different living Germanic languages, 41 of which belong to the Western branch and six to the Northern branch; it places Riograndenser Hunsrückisch German in neither of the categories, but it is often considered a German dialect by linguists. The total number of Germanic languages throughout history is unknown as some of them, especially the East Germanic languages, disappeared during or after the Migration Period. Some of the West Germanic languages also did not survive past the Migration Period, including Lombardic. As a result of World War II, the German language suffered a significant loss of <i>Sprachraum</i>, as well as moribundness and extinction of several of its dialects. In the 21st century, its dialects are dying out anyway due to Standard German gaining primacy.</p><p>The common ancestor of all of the languages in this branch is called Proto-Germanic, also known as Common Germanic, which was spoken in about the middle of the 1st millennium BC in Iron Age Scandinavia. Proto-Germanic, along with all of its descendants, is characterised by a number of unique linguistic features, most famously the consonant change known as Grimm's law. Early varieties of Germanic entered history with the Germanic tribes moving south from Scandinavia in the 2nd century BC, to settle in the area of today's northern Germany and southern Denmark. </p>

<p><b>Letter case</b> (or just <b>case</b>) is the distinction between the letters that are in larger <b>upper case</b> (also <i>uppercase</i>, <i>capital letters</i>, <i>capitals</i>, <i>caps</i>, <i>large letters</i>, or more formally <i>majuscule</i>) and smaller <b>lower case</b> (also <i>lowercase</i>, <i>small letters</i>, or more formally <i>minuscule</i>) in the written representation of certain languages. The writing systems that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters, with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set. The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and pronunciation and will be treated identically when sorting in alphabetical order. </p><p>Letter case is generally applied in a mixed-case fashion, with both upper- and lower-case letters appearing in a given piece of text. The choice of case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In orthography, the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun, which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text. In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters, which are easier to distinguish than the lower case, especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small. In mathematics, on the other hand, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects, with upper-case letters often representing "superior" objects (e.g. <i>X</i> could be a set containing the generic member <i>x</i>). </p>

<p><b>Avokaya</b> (also spelled <i>Abukeia</i>, <i>Avukaya</i>, or, in Arabic script, <i lang="ar-Latn" title="DIN 31635 Arabic (Arabic language) transliteration">ابوكية</i>) is a Central Sudanic language spoken in southern South Sudan and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Avokaya speakers occupy a contiguous area along both sides of the international boundary, with Maridi in South Sudan and Faradje in Congo as the main centres of the language. In 2002, the number of Avokaya speakers in South Sudan was estimated to be 40,000, replacing the inaccurate 1982 estimate of 15,000. However, the 1989 estimate of 25,000 speakers in the Congo still stands. </p><p>Avokaya's two main dialects are Ajugu, which is spoken in the border area of the two countries south of Maridi, and Ojila, which is spoken in the region between the Naam (Era) and Olo rivers, and slightly east of there. These two dialects are spoken in both countries, with the smaller dialects of Northern Ogambi and Avokaya Pur spoken only in the Faradje region, Congo. Avokaya is closest to Logo, especially in the Northern Ogambi dialect (whereas the Ogambi dialect is a dialect of Logo rather than Avokaya. A high degree of code switching exists among Avokaya and Logo speakers in the Faradje region. </p><p>In Maridi, there is much bilingualism and intermarriage with speakers of Baka (a West Central Sudanic language) and Mündü (an Ubangian language). Juba, Sudanese Arabic and English are used for wider communication by speakers in Sudan, while, in the Congo, speakers tend to use Swahili, Lingala and French. </p>

<p>There are many languages spoken on the Caribbean island of Aruba. The official languages are Dutch and Papiamento, although schools require students to learn English, Spanish, French, and to a lesser extent, Portuguese which is also spoken on the island. According to the Government of Aruba the mother tongue and primary vernacular of almost all Arubans is a local language known as Papiamento, an Afro-Portuguese Creole language spoken since the 16th century. The language, however, was not widespread in Aruba till the 18th and 19th centuries when most materials on the island and even Roman Catholic schoolbooks were written in Papiamento. </p><p><b>Dutch</b> has been one of the official languages of the island for years as the island is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administrative and legal matters. Aruba has recognized <b>English</b> as an international language, and has required that children learn English as early as the 4th grade. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire; when Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials noted the already widespread use of the language.. Since May 2003, Papiamento has also been an official language, alongside Dutch.  Aruba's location off the coast of South America has also made <b>Spanish</b> extremely important. Students begin learning this as early as 5th grade. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia, and several Venezuelan TV networks are received, and the fact that Aruba has Venezuelan and Colombian residents. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.</p><p>Papiamento is a language with roots mainly from Portuguese, and to a lesser extent, from Dutch, Spanish and English. It originated in the 16th century as a pidgin language for communication among slaves and slave drivers. </p><p>Papiamento was not considered important on Aruba until 1995. It was officially included in the school curriculum in 1998 and 1999. Since then, the island has embraced this native language. A Papiamento dictionary and fairy tales written in Papiamento are now readily available on the island. </p><p>Aruba is a polyglot society. Most of Aruba's population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish. </p>

<p><b>Decapoint</b>, or <i>raphigraphy</i>, was a tactile form of the Latin script invented by Louis Braille as a system that could be used by both the blind and sighted. It was published in 1839. Letters retained their linear form, and so were legible without training to the sighted, but the lines were composed of embossed dots like those used in braille. Each letter contained ten dots in the height and different dots in the width to produce the graphic form of print. </p><p>The reason for the development of this writing was that relatives of the students could not read braille. </p><p>These letters were not easy for the blind to write because of their height of ten dots despite grid. It therefore did not take long for the blind friend of Louis Braille Pierre-François-Victor Foucault in 1841 to build the first apparatus, the Raphigraph, which could push all the points of one column of characters at the same time into the paper. This font was now named <b>Raphigraphy</b> (Raphigrafie or Raphigraphie). </p><p>When the first typewriters were invented, they repressed quickly the complicated Raphigraphy or decapoint, despite the impossibility for the blind to read the writing of typewriters. And so the Decapoint or Raphigraphy fell into oblivion, but it was the first digital font of Latin letters ever. </p>

<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><b>Linear A</b> is one of two currently undeciphered writing systems used in ancient Greece (Cretan hieroglyphic is the other). Linear A was the primary script used in palace and religious writings of the Minoan civilization. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. It is related to the Linear B script, which succeeded the Linear A and was used by the Mycenaean civilization. </p><p>In the 1950s, Linear B was largely deciphered and found to encode an early form of Greek. Although the two systems share many symbols, this did not lead to a subsequent decipherment of Linear A. Using the values associated with Linear B in Linear A mainly produces unintelligible words. If Linear A uses the same or similar syllabic values as Linear B, then its associated language, dubbed "Minoan", appears unrelated to any known language. </p>
<p><b>Roland Grubb Kent</b> (February 24, 1877 – June 27, 1952) was an American Educator and a founder of the Linguistic Society of America.  He was the first to translate Varro's <i>De Lingua Latina</i> into English.  His 1903 doctoral thesis on the history of Thessaly traces the history of the country with particular attention to the times between 600 and 300 BC. Unfortunately, only Chapter V and two appendices were published, and the bulk of his dissertation is currently lost. His <i>Old Persian: Grammar, Texts, Lexicon</i> is one of the seminal works on the subject.</p>
<p><b>Gremlin</b> is a graph traversal language and virtual machine developed by Apache TinkerPop of the Apache Software Foundation. Gremlin works for both OLTP-based graph databases as well as OLAP-based graph processors. Gremlin's automata and functional language foundation enable Gremlin to naturally support imperative and declarative querying, host language agnosticism, user-defined domain specific languages, an extensible compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models, hybrid depth- and breadth-first evaluation, as well as Turing Completeness.</p><p>As an explanatory analogy, Apache TinkerPop and Gremlin are to graph databases what the JDBC and SQL are to relational databases. Likewise, the Gremlin traversal machine is to graph computing as what the Java virtual machine is to general purpose computing.</p>
<p><b>Surinamese Dutch</b> (Dutch: <i>Surinaams-Nederlands</i>, <small>Dutch pronunciation: </small><span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ˌsyːriˈnaːms ˈneːdərˌlɑnts]</span>) is the form of Dutch spoken in Suriname and is the official language in Suriname, a former Dutch colony. Dutch is spoken as a native language by about 60% of the population, most of them being bilingual with Sranan Tongo, Hindustani, Javanese, and other languages. Nevertheless, Dutch is the sole official language of the country. Surinamese Dutch is easily intelligible with other forms of Dutch. Furthermore, as opposed to other languages that have different forms in the Americas (e.g., American English vs. British English) the regulation and thus standardised spelling of the Dutch language is done through a joint Dutch-Belgian-Surinamese organization, the Dutch Language Union, and thus has no regional differences regarding spelling. Suriname has been an associate member of this Nederlandse Taalunie since 2005. Therefore, many typical Surinamese words were added to the official Wordlist of Standard Dutch, known as "the Green Booklet" (<i>Groene Boekje</i>). </p><p>Some words exclusive to Surinamese Dutch are <i>okseltruitje, bacove, cellulair, wied, zwamp, roti, kouseband, schaafijs, bobo</i> and <i>buitenvrouw.</i> Surinamese Dutch has been heavily influenced by other languages spoken by residents. </p>
<p><b>Barrovian</b> (or <b>Barrow dialect</b>) is an accent and dialect of English found in Barrow-in-Furness and several parts of the town's wider borough in Cumbria, England. Although technically a subgroup of the Cumbrian dialect, Barrovian is distinct in having more in common with the Lancashire dialect and influences of immigrant groups from across the northern regions of the British Isles. </p><p>Barrovian is also used as a Demonym for inhabitants of Barrow. </p>
<p><b>Natchez</b> is the ancestral language of the Natchez people who historically inhabited Mississippi and Louisiana, and who now mostly live among the Creek and Cherokee peoples in Oklahoma. The language is considered to be either unrelated to other indigenous languages of the Americas or distantly related to the Muskogean languages. </p><p>The phonology of Natchez is atypical in having voicing distinction in its sonorants but not in its obstruents; it also has a wide range of morphophonemic processes. Morphologically, it has complex verbal inflection and a relatively simple nominal inflection (the ergative case marks nouns in transitive clauses), and its syntax is characterized by active-stative alignment and subject-object-verb word order (or more accurately Agent-Object-Verb and Subject-Verb). Natchez storytellers used a specific register, "cannibal speech" to impersonate cannibals, a recurring character in Natchez oral literature. </p><p>The Natchez chiefdom was destroyed in the 1730s by the French; Natchez speakers took refuge among their neighbors and accompanied them when they were eventually driven to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears. That meant that Natchez speakers were frequently multilingual in Creek, Cherokee, Natchez, and English, and the language gradually became endangered, and it is now generally considered extinct in spite of recent revitalization efforts. What is known of the language comes mostly from its last fluent speakers, Watt Sam and Nancy Raven, who worked with linguist Mary R. Haas in the 1930s. </p><p>The Natchez nation is now working to revive it as a spoken language. As of 2011, field linguists from the community were being trained in documentation techniques, and six members of the Natchez tribe in Oklahoma now speak the language, out of about 10,000.</p>   
<p><b>Paul Smolensky</b> (born May 5, 1955) is a professor of Cognitive Science at the Johns Hopkins University. </p><p>Along with Alan Prince, he developed Optimality Theory, a representational model of linguistics.  Optimality Theory is popularly used for phonology, the subfield to which it was originally applied, but has been extended to other areas of linguistics such as syntax and semantics. </p><p>Smolensky is the recipient of the 2005 Rumelhart Prize for his pursuit of the ICS Architecture, a model of cognition that aims to unify Connectionism and symbolism, where the symbolic representations and operations are manifested as abstractions on the underlying connectionist networks.  Among his other important ideas is the notion of local conjunction of constraints - the idea that two constraints can combine into a single constraint that is violated only when both of its conjuncts are violated.  Local conjunction has been applied to the analysis of various "super-additive" effects in Optimality Theory.  With Bruce Tesar (Rutgers University), Smolensky has also contributed significantly to the study of the learnability of Optimality Theoretic grammars. </p><p>He is a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing. </p>
<p>In computer science, <b>A-normal form</b> (abbreviated <b>ANF</b>) is an intermediate representation of programs in functional compilers introduced by Sabry and Felleisen in 1992 as a simpler alternative to continuation-passing style (CPS).  Some of the advantages of using CPS as an intermediate representation are that optimizations are easier to perform on programs in CPS than in the source language, and that it is also easier for compilers to generate machine code for programs in CPS. Flanagan et al. showed how compilers could use ANF to achieve those same benefits with one source-level transformation; in contrast, for realistic compilers the CPS transformation typically involves additional phases, for example, to simplify CPS terms. </p><p>In ANF, all arguments to a function must be trivial.  That is, evaluation of each argument must halt immediately. </p><p>This article deals with the basic definition expressed in terms of the λ-calculus with weak reduction and let-expressions, where the restriction is enforced by </p> <ol><li>allowing only constants, λ-terms, and variables, to serve as arguments of function applications, and</li> <li>requiring that the result of a non-trivial expression be captured by a let-bound variable or returned from a function.</li></ol>
<p><b>Louisiana French</b> (French: <i lang="fr">français de la Louisiane</i>, Louisiana Creole: <i>françé la lwizyàn</i>) refers to the complex of dialects and varieties of the French language spoken traditionally in colonial Lower Louisiana. As of today Louisiana French is primarily used in the U.S. state of Louisiana, specifically in the southern parishes, though substantial minorities exist in southeast Texas as well. Over the centuries, the language has incorporated some words of African, Spanish, Native American and English origin, sometimes giving it linguistic features found only in Louisiana, but it remains mutually intelligible with other forms of the French language. Figures from the United States Census record that roughly 3.5% of Louisianans over the age of 5 report speaking French or a French-based creole at home.</p><p>The language is spoken across ethnic and racial lines by people who identify as Cajun or Louisiana Creole as well as Chitimacha, Houma, Biloxi, Tunica, Choctaw, Acadian, and French among others. For these reasons, as well as the relatively small influence Acadian French has had on the language, the label <b>Louisiana French</b> or <b>Louisiana Regional French</b> is generally regarded as more accurate and inclusive than "Cajun French" and is preferred term by linguists and anthropologists. However, "Cajun French" is commonly used in lay discourse by speakers of the language and other inhabitants of Louisiana.</p><p>Louisiana French should further not be confused with Louisiana Creole, a distinct French-based creole language indigenous to Louisiana and spoken across racial lines. In Louisiana, language labels are often conflated with ethnic labels. For example, a speaker who identifies as Cajun may call their language "Cajun French", though linguists would identify it as Louisiana Creole.</p><p>Parishes in which the dialect is still found include but are not limited to Acadia, Ascension, Assumption, Avoyelles, Cameron, Evangeline, Iberia, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Lafourche, St. Martin, St. Mary, Terrebonne, Pointe Coupée, Vermillion, and other parishes of southern Louisiana. </p>

<p><b>California English</b> (or <b>Californian English</b>) collectively refers to American English in California, particularly an emerging youthful variety, mostly associated with  speakers of urban and coastal California. California is home to a highly diverse population, which is reflected in the historical and continuing formation of California English, whose emergent vowel shift was only first noted by linguists in the 1980s, best researched in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area of Northern California. Since that time, unique California speech has been mostly associated in American popular culture with adolescent and young-adult speakers of coastal California; the possibility that it is, in fact, an age-specific variety of English is one hypothesis that has been proposed but not confirmed. Other documented California English includes a "country" accent associated with rural and inland white Californians as well as unique California varieties of Chicano English associated with Mexican Americans. </p>

<p>The <b>Elgon languages</b> are languages of the Southern Nilotic Kalenjin family spoken in the Mount Elgon area in western Kenya and eastern Uganda. According to the Ethnologue, there are two main Elgon languages: Kupsabiny (spoken by about 120,000 people) and Sabaot (spoken by about 134,000 people). Sabaot is a common name assumed by various related peoples, including the Kony, Pok, and Bong'om (after whom the Western Kenyan town of Bungoma is named), whose respective languages are considered separate languages by Rottland (1982). </p><p>The Terik people, living east of Lake Victoria wedged in between the Nandi, Luo and Luyia, spoke or speak a dialect closely related to Pok and Bong'om. According to their own oral history they are "people of Mount Elgon"; this is confirmed by Bong'om traditions that "the people who later called themselves Terik were still Bong'om when they left Elgon and moved away in a southern direction" (Roeder 1986:142). Recently many of them have assimilated to neighbouring Nandi, leading to a decline in the use of the Terik language in favor of Nandi. Although they live in two countries, both groups speak the same language but with slightly different pronunciations. </p>

<p><b>Common Lisp</b> (<b>CL</b>) is a dialect of the Lisp programming language, published in ANSI standard document <i>ANSI INCITS 226-1994 (R2004)</i> (formerly <i>X3.226-1994 (R1999)</i>). The Common Lisp HyperSpec, a hyperlinked HTML version, has been derived from the ANSI Common Lisp standard.</p><p>The Common Lisp language was developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp. By the early 1980s several groups were already at work on diverse successors to MacLisp: Lisp Machine Lisp (aka ZetaLisp), Spice Lisp, NIL and S-1 Lisp. Common Lisp sought to unify, standardise, and extend the features of these MacLisp dialects. Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products. Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. It supports a combination of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms. As a dynamic programming language, it facilitates evolutionary and incremental software development, with iterative compilation into efficient run-time programs. This incremental development is often done interactively without interrupting the running application. </p><p>It also supports optional type annotation and casting, which can be added as necessary at the later profiling and optimization stages, to permit the compiler to generate more efficient code. For instance, <code>fixnum</code> can hold an unboxed integer in a range supported by the hardware and implementation, permitting more efficient arithmetic than on big integers or arbitrary precision types.  Similarly, the compiler can be told on a per-module or per-function basis which type safety level is wanted, using <i>optimize</i> declarations. </p><p>Common Lisp includes CLOS, an object system that supports multimethods and method combinations. It is often implemented with a Metaobject Protocol. </p><p>Common Lisp is extensible through standard features such as <i>Lisp macros</i> (code transformations) and <i>reader macros</i> (input parsers for characters). </p><p>Common Lisp provides some backwards compatibility to Maclisp and to John McCarthy's original Lisp. This allows older Lisp software to be ported to Common Lisp.</p>

Point talk cards are also used by police and emergency services personnel to communicate with people who do not speak the authority's language.</p>
<p><b>Kató Lomb</b> (Pécs, February 8, 1909 – Budapest, June 9, 2003) was a Hungarian interpreter, translator and one of the first simultaneous  interpreters in the world.  Originally she graduated in physics and chemistry, but her interest soon led her to languages. Native in Hungarian, she was able to interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four of them even without preparation), and she translated technical literature and read belles-lettres in six languages. She was able to understand journalism in further eleven languages. As she put it, altogether she earned money with sixteen languages (Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian). She learned these languages mostly by self-effort, as an autodidact. Her aims to acquire these languages were most of all practical, to satisfy her interest. </p><p>According to her own account, her long life was highlighted not primarily by the command of languages but the actual study of them. Through her books, published in Hungarian in several editions as well as in some other languages, interviews (in print and on the air) and conversations, she tried to share this joy with generations. As an interpreter, she visited five continents, saw forty countries, and reported about her experiences and adventures in a separate book (<i>Egy tolmács a világ körül</i>, "An interpreter around the world"). </p>

<p><b>Cusco–Collao</b> (Spanish, also <i>Cuzco–Collao</i>) or <b>Qusqu–Qullaw</b> (Quechua) is a collective term used for Quechua dialects that have aspirated (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">tʃʰ, pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, qʰ</span>) and ejective (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">tʃʼ, pʼ, tʼ, kʼ, qʼ</span>) plosives, apparently borrowed from Aymaran languages. They include Cusco Quechua, Puno Quechua, North Bolivian Quechua, and South Bolivian Quechua. Together with Ayacucho Quechua, which is mutually intelligible, they form the Southern Quechua language. </p><p>In 1975, the term "Cusco-Collao" was coined by the government of Juan Velasco Alvarado as the name of one of six officially recognized regional varieties of Quechua in Peru, and is still used in both Spanish and Quechua forms in publications of the Peruvian government and SIL International.</p><p>In linguistic terms, the group is problematic. Concerning vocabulary, Cusco Quechua is closest to Ayacucho Quechua, with which it has 96% lexical similarity, whereas Puno Quechua and the Bolivian Quechua varieties have borrowed more lexicon and morphology from Aymara and Spanish (e.g. the diminutive suffix <i>-ita, -itu, -sita, -situ</i> instead of <i>-cha</i>: cf. "small stone": <i>rumisitu</i> in Bolivia vs. <i>rumicha</i> in both Cusco and Ayacucho). Typical for Cusco-Collao dialects is the appearance of subordinating conjunctions, e.g. <i>imaraykuchus</i> (because) and <i>sichus</i> (if), or relative pronouns, e.g. <i>pitachus</i> (whom) or <i>imachus</i> (that, what), which are uncommon in Ayacucho Quechua and other Quechua varieties. Conjunctions like <i>imaraykuchus</i> are by far most common in the Bolivian dialects. Otherwise, subordination in Quechua can be expressed by means of suffixes and infixes like <i>-pti-</i> and <i>-spa</i> or (to substitute relative clauses) <i>-q</i>, <i>-sqa</i> and <i>-na</i>. </p>

<p><b>Audio mining</b> is a technique by which the content of an audio signal can be automatically analysed and searched. It is most commonly used in the field of automatic speech recognition, where the analysis tries to identify any speech within the audio. The audio will typically be processed by a speech recognition system in order to identify word or phoneme units that are likely to occur in the spoken content. This information may either be used immediately in pre-defined searches for keywords or phrases (a real-time "word spotting" system), or the output of the speech recogniser may be stored in an index file. One or more audio mining index files can then be loaded at a later date in order to run searches for keywords or phrases. </p><p>The results of a search will normally be in terms of hits, which are regions within files that are good matches for the chosen keywords. The user may then be able to listen to the audio corresponding to these hits in order to verify if a correct match was found. </p><p>Audio mining systems used in the field of speech recognition are often divided into two groups: those that use Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognisers (LVCSR) and those that use phonetic recognition.  </p><p>Musical audio mining (also known as music information retrieval) relates to the identification of perceptually important characteristics of a piece of music such as melodic, harmonic or rhythmic structure.

<p>In theoretical linguistics,  a speaker's judgement on the well-formedness of a linguistic utterance—called a <b>grammaticality judgement</b>—is based on whether the sentence is produced and interpreted in accordance with the rules and constraints of the relevant grammar. If the rules and constraints of the particular language are followed then the sentence is considered to be grammatical. In contrast, an ungrammatical sentence is one that violates the rules of the given language. </p><p>Linguists use grammaticality judgements to investigate the syntactic structure of sentences. Generative linguists are largely of the opinion that for native speakers of natural languages, grammaticality is a matter of linguistic intuition, and reflects the innate linguistic competence of speakers. Therefore, generative linguistics attempts to predict grammaticality judgements exhaustively. On the other hand, for linguists who stress the role of social learning,  in contrast to innate knowledge of language, such as Hopper 1987 there has been a gradual abandonment of talk about grammaticality in favour of acceptability.</p>

The exact century of separation is unknown, but this separation of Sanskrit and Avestan occurred certainly before 1800 BCE. The Avestan language developed in ancient Persia, was the language of Zoroastrianism, but was a dead language in the Sasanian period. Vedic Sanskrit developed independently in ancient India, evolved into classical Sanskrit after the grammar and linguistic treatise of Pāṇini, and later into many related Indian subcontinent languages in which are found the voluminous ancient and medieval literature of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism.</p>

<p>In linguistics, a feature of a word or phrase is said to be <b>covert</b> if there is no surface evidence of its existence within that word or phrase. For example, many languages have covert grammatical gender in nouns, in that there is no way to tell from the form of a noun which gender it is; gender only becomes apparent in, for example, articles and adjectival agreement, which depend on gender. In German instruction, the article (<i>die</i>, <i>der</i>, <i>das</i>) is generally taught along with a noun, so that the student may remember which gender the noun is. In French, grammatical number is largely covert: the singular and plural forms of most nouns are identical in pronunciation. However, number is still relevant, as it affects articles and verbal agreement, so it is still logical to say that one instance of a noun is singular, and that another instance, pronounced identically, is plural. </p><p>A covert feature is different from a null morpheme, such as the English singular, which is marked by the <i>absence</i> of a morpheme that occurs elsewhere. That is, whereas in English the null-marked singular contrasts with an overt <i>-s</i> plural in most nouns, in French both singular and plural are null; in English it is clear that <i>cat</i> is singular, because it is not the plural <i>cats</i>, whereas in spoken French, it cannot be known whether <i>chat(s)</i> <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">[ʃa]</span> spoken in isolation is singular or plural.  </p>

<p><b>Hermann Heinrich Vedder</b> (* 3 July 1876 in Westerenger, Westfalen, Germany; † 26 April 1972 in Okahandja, South-West Africa) was a German missionary, linguist, ethnologist and historian. Originally a silk weaver, he received missionary training by the Rhenish Missionary Society in Barmen between 1894 and 1903, whereafter he was sent to German South West Africa in 1905 and worked as a missionary and teacher trainer until his retirement, first for the black workers and prisoners-of-war in Swakopmund, then at the small mission station Gaub in the Otavi Mountains, and from 1922 onwards in Okahandja, where he taught at the Augustineum school.  </p><p>After his retirement, the National Party Government of South Africa nominated his as Senator to represent the Namibian 'natives' (who had no vote) in the South African Senate in 1951. He vehemently defended the policy of apartheid. In his first speech he stated: "Our Government in South West Africa has been the depositary of a fine heritage. From the very beginning the German Government carried out that which has unfortunately not yet been attained in South Africa - namely, apartheid."</p><p>Vedder spoke fluently Oshindonga, Khoekhoe, and Otjiherero. He spent a lot of his time recording oral history and folklore and wrote school textbooks in Otjiherero and Khoekhoegowab.</p><p>His best known works are the ethnographic treatise <i>Die Bergdama</i> on history and culture of the Damara, his work on the pre-colonial history of South West Africa, <i>South West Africa in Early Times</i>, and his contribution to <i>The native tribes of South West Africa</i>. Vedder's historiography has been heavily criticized by recent academic historians for being not referenced and for its colonial apologetics and settler bias.</p><p>He received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Tübingen (1925) and Stellenbosch (1949). A suburb of Okahandja is named <i>Veddersdal</i> (Afrikaans: Vedder's valley) in his honour. </p>

<p><b>Less</b> (Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as <b>LESS</b>) is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client side or server side. Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is influenced by Sass and has influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its CSS-like block formatting syntax. Less is open source. Its first version was written in Ruby; however, in the later versions, use of Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The indented syntax of Less is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less code with the same semantics. Less provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that Less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser.</p>

<p><b>Yam</b> (also <i>Yamm</i>) is the   god of the sea in the Canaanite pantheon.

Also titled <i>ṯpṭ nhr</i> "Judge River", he is also one of the <i> 'ilhm</i> (<i>Elohim</i>) or sons of El, the name given to the Levantine pantheon.   </p><p>Of all the gods, despite being the champion of El, Yam holds special hostility against Baal Hadad, son of Dagon. Yam is a deity of the sea and his palace is in the abyss associated with the depths, or Biblical tehom, of the oceans.   Yam is the deity of the primordial chaos and represents the power of the sea, untamed and raging; he is seen as ruling storms and the disasters they wreak, and was an important divinity to the maritime Phoenicians. The gods cast out Yam from the heavenly mountain Sappan (modern Jebel Aqra; <i>Sappan</i> is cognate to <i>Tsephon</i>).</p><p>The fight of Baal-Hadad with Yam has long been equated with the <i>Chaoskampf</i> mytheme in Mesopotamian mythology in which a god fights and destroys a "dragon" or sea monster; the seven-headed dragon Lotan is associated closely with him and Yam is often described as <i>the serpent</i>. Both Mesopotamian Tiamat and Biblical Leviathan are adduced as reflexes of this narrative, as is the fight of Zeus with Typhon in Greek mythology.</p>

His research on American Sign Language (ASL) revolutionized the understanding of ASL in the United States and sign languages throughout the world and had a profound impact on deaf culture, deaf education, and sign language teaching and interpreting. Stokoe's work led to a widespread recognition that sign languages are true languages, exhibiting syntax and morphology, and are not mere systems of gesture. This work thus redefined "language" itself, and influenced thinking in theoretical linguistics, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, neural studies, and even jurisprudence.</p>
<p><b>Citrine</b> is a general purpose programming language for Unix-like operating systems. It focuses on readability and maintainability. Readability is achieved by syntactic and conceptual minimalism. The language is heavily inspired by Smalltalk and Self but has some very distinctive features. Like Smalltalk, Citrine treats everything as an object and focuses on sending messages to these objects. However unlike Smalltalk, Citrine lacks the concept of a class. In this regard, Citrine is more like Self and JavaScript because it uses prototypes. The combination of Smalltalk like messages and prototypes is what makes Citrine unique. </p><p>As of the 0.7 version Citrine has focused on supporting native human languages instead of just English to help people reduce the number of bugs because of confusion and misunderstandig due to language barriers. As such Citrine 0.7 and higher feature a translator to translate between human languages. </p>
<p><b>SystemVerilog DPI</b> (Direct Programming Interface) is an interface which can be used to interface SystemVerilog with foreign languages. These Foreign languages can be C, C++, SystemC as well as others. DPIs consist of two layers: A SystemVerilog Layer and a Foreign language layer. Both the layers are isolated from each other. Which programming language is actually used as the foreign language is transparent and irrelevant for the System-Verilog side of this interface. Neither the SystemVerilog compiler nor the foreign language compiler is required to analyze the source code in the other’s language. Different programming languages can be used and supported with the same intact SystemVerilog layer. For now, however, SystemVerilog defines a foreign language layer only for the C programming language. </p><p>The motivation for this interface is two-fold. The methodological requirement is that the interface should allow a heterogeneous system to be built (a design or a testbench) in which some components can be written in a language (or more languages) other than SystemVerilog, hereinafter called the foreign language. On the other hand, there is also a practical need for an easy and efficient way to connect existing code, usually written in C or C++, without the knowledge and the overhead of PLI or VPI. DPI follows the principle of a black box: the specification and the implementation of a component are clearly separated, and the actual implementation is transparent to the rest of the system. Therefore, the actual  programming language of the implementation is also transparent, although this standard defines only C linkage semantics. The separation between SystemVerilog code and the foreign language is based on using  functions as the natural encapsulation unit in SystemVerilog. By and large, any function can be treated as a black box and implemented either in SystemVerilog or in the foreign language in a transparent way, without changing its calls. </p>

<p><b>Writer invariant</b>, also called <b>authorial invariant</b> or <b>author's invariant</b>, is a property of a text which is invariant of its author, that is, it will be similar in all texts of a given author and different in texts of different authors. It can be used to find plagiarism or discover who is real author of anonymously published text. Writer invariant is also an author's pattern of writing a letter in handwritten text recognition.</p><p>While it is generally recognised that writer invariants exist, it is not agreed what properties of a text should be used. Among the first ones used was distribution of word lengths; other proposed invariants include average sentence length, average word length, noun, verb or adjective usage frequency, vocabulary richness, and frequency of function words, or specific function words.</p><p>Of these, average sentence lengths can be very similar in works of different authors or vary significantly even within a single work; average word lengths likewise turn out to be very similar in works of different authors. Analysis of function words shows promise because they are used by authors unconsciously.</p>
<p>The <b>Totonacan languages</b> (also known as Totonac–Tepehua languages) are a family of closely related languages spoken by approximately 290,000 Totonac (approx. 280,000) and Tepehua (approx. 10,000) people in the states of Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo in Mexico. At the time of the Spanish conquest Totonacan languages were spoken all along the gulf coast of Mexico (Reid &amp; Bishop 1974). During the colonial period Totonacan languages were occasionally written and at least one grammar was produced (Anonymous 1990). In the 20th century the number of speakers of most varieties have dwindled as indigenous identity increasingly became stigmatized encouraging speakers to adopt Spanish as their main language (Lam 2009). </p><p>The Totonacan languages have only recently been compared to other families on the basis of historical-comparative linguistics, though they share numerous areal features with other languages of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, such as the Mayan languages and Nahuatl. Recent work suggests a possible genetic link to the Mixe–Zoque language family (Brown et al. 2011), although this has yet to be firmly established. </p>

It probably survived in Aquitania until the Early Middle Ages. </p><p>Archaeological, toponymical, and historical evidence shows that it was a Vasconic language or group of languages that represent a precursor of the Basque language. The most important pieces of evidence are a series of votive and funerary texts in Latin which contain about 400 personal names and 70 names of gods. </p>
<p>The question whether the use of language influences spatial cognition is closely related to theories of linguistic relativity—also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis—which states that the structure of a language affects cognitive processes of the speaker. Debates about this topic are mainly focused on the extent to which language influences spatial cognition or if it does at all. Research also concerns differences between perspectives on spatial relations across cultures, what these imply, and the exploration of potentially partaking cognitive mechanisms. </p>
<p class="mw-empty-elt">  </p> <p><i><b>Ek Se Bhadkar Ek</b></i> is a 1976 Hindi movie, with action, comedy and drama. The story is about two brothers who were separated and both became thieves.

Due to the success of the movie, it was remade in Telugu as <i>Mugguru Muggure</i>. </p>
<p><b>Heinrich Morf</b> (23 October 1854, in Münchenbuchsee – 23 January 1921, in Thun) was a Swiss linguist and literary historian. </p><p>He studied Indo-Germanic and classical philology at the University of Zürich (1873–75) and Romance philology at the University of Strasbourg (1875–77), receiving his doctorate in 1877 with the dissertation <i>Die Wortstellung im altfranzösischen Rolandslied</i>. Following graduation, he continued his education in Spain (1877/78) and Paris (1878/79), where he was a student of Gaston Paris. In 1879 he was named an associate professor of Romance philology at the University of Bern. Later on, he served as a professor at the University of Zürich (from 1889; successor to Heinrich Breitinger), the Akademie für Sozial- und Handelswissenschaft in Frankfurt (from 1901; rector in 1901–03) and the University of Berlin (from 1910) as successor to Adolf Tobler.</p><p>He was a catalyst towards the creation of the <i>Glossaire des patois de la Suisse romande</i> ("Glossary of the patois of French-speaking Switzerland"), an institution founded by Louis Gauchat and others. In 1914 he was one of the subscribers to the so-called "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three".</p>
<p><b>TSP</b> is a programming language for the estimation and simulation of econometric models. TSP stands for "Time Series Processor", although it is also commonly used with cross section and panel data. The program was initially developed by Robert Hall during his graduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s. The company behind the program is TSP International which was founded in 1978 by Bronwyn H. Hall, Robert Hall's wife. After their divorce in April 1983, the asset of TSP was split into two versions, and subsequently the two versions have diverged in terms of interface and types of subroutines included. One version is TSP, still developed by TSP International. The other version, initially named MicroTSP, is now named EViews, developed by Quantitative Micro Software. </p>

<p><b>Ural–Altaic</b>, <b>Uralo-Altaic</b> or <b>Uraltaic</b>, also known as <b>Turanian</b>, is an obsolete language-family proposal uniting the Uralic and the widely discredited Altaic languages. </p><p>Originally suggested in the 18th century, the hypothesis remained debated into the mid-20th century, often with disagreements exacerbated by pan-nationalist agendas. It had many proponents in Britain. Since the 1960s, the hypothesis has been widely rejected. From the 1990s, interest in a relationship between the Altaic, Indo-European and Uralic families has been revived in the context of the Eurasiatic linguistic superfamily hypothesis.  Bomhard (2008) treats Uralic, Altaic and Indo-European as Eurasiatic daughter groups on equal footing.</p><p>Both Ural-Altaic and Altaic remain relevant — and still insufficiently understood — concepts of areal linguistics and typology, even if in a genetic sense these terms might be considered as obsolete.</p>
<p><b>Mattenenglisch</b>, in Bernese German Dialect <b>Mattenänglisch</b>, is a name for the varieties traditionally spoken in the <i>Matte</i>, the old working class neighbourhood of the Swiss City of Bern. It is used in two different senses: Either for the traditional sociolect of that neighbourhood or for a special kind of Pig Latin that was used there. In the second half of the 20th century, both have fallen out of use because after the traditional social stratification has been completely changed, the <i>Matte</i> is no longer a working-class neighbourhood. However, there are voluntary associations that cultivate Mattenenglisch. </p>
<p><b>Ternate</b> or <b>Ternatese</b> (<i>bahasa Ternate</i>, <i>bahasa Tarnate</i>) is a North Halmahera language of Indonesia.

<p><b>Desmond Patrick Costello</b> (31 January 1912 – 23 February 1964) was a New Zealand linguist, soldier, diplomat, university professor who was accused of being an agent for the Soviet GRU and of having sparked the first in a series of spy scandals in the 1960s which brought down the Macmillan government in the UK.</p><p>He was born in Auckland, New Zealand.</p><p>Eminent New Zealand author Sir James McNeish researched and wrote a biography of Paddy Costello entitled <i> The Sixth Man: the extraordinary life of Paddy Costello</i> (Random House, 2007). In the preface to this book, Philip Knightley writes that "This long overdue biography sets the record straight. It convincingly shows that the slim evidence for the traitor charge was invented, exaggerated and misinterpreted." Costello's MI5 file was released to the public in April 2017, but it fails to settle the issue of his supposed treachery.</p><p>Paddy Costello also features in McNeish's multiple biography <i>Dance of the Peacocks: New Zealanders in exile in the time of Hitler and Mao Tse Tung</i> (Vintage, 2003)  about five exceptional New Zealanders, four of them Rhodes scholars, who became caught up in the turmoil of their time.

<p><b>Dahl's law</b> is a sound rule in some of the Northeast Bantu languages, a case of voicing dissimilation. In the history of these languages, a voiceless stop, such as <span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/p t k/</span>, became voiced (<span title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">/b d ɡ/</span>) when immediately followed by a syllable with another voiceless stop. For example, Nyamwezi has <i>-datu</i> "three" where Swahili, a Bantu language that did not undergo Dahl's law, has <i>-tatu</i>, and Shambala has <i>mgate</i> "bread" where Swahili has <i>mkate</i>. Dahl's law is the reason for the name Gikuyu when the language prefix normally found in that language is <i>ki-</i> . </p><p>The law was named in 1903 by Carl Meinhof after the missionary Edmund Dahl, who had discovered it. It is productive in Sukuma, in the Nyanyembe dialect of Nyamwezi, most E50 languages (such as Kikuyu, Embu, Meru/Chuka), some J languages (such as Rwanda, Gusii, Kuria). In other languages the law is no longer productive, but there are indications that it once was (such as in Taita, Kamba/Daisũ, Taveta, Luhya/Logoli). In some neighboring languages (and in other dialects of Nyamwezi) words reflecting Dahl's law are found, but they appear to be transfers from languages in which the law is productive.</p><p>Dahl's law is often portrayed as the African equivalent of Grassmann's law in Indo-European languages. However, an analogue of Grassmann's law (which is aspiration, not voicing, dissimilation) has taken place in the Bantu language Makhuwa, where it is called <i>Katupha's law.</i> </p>

<p><b>Bakhtiari dialect</b> is a dialect of Southern Luri spoken by Bakhtiari people in Chaharmahal-o-Bakhtiari, Bushehr, western Khuzestan and parts of Isfahan and Lorestan provinces.  It is closely related to the Boir-Aḥmadī, Kohgīlūya, and Mamasanī dialects in northwestern Fars.  These dialects, together with the Lori dialects of Lorestan (e.g. Khorramabadi dialect), are referred to as the <i>“Perside” southern Zagros group</i>, or Lori dialects. "Luri and Bakhtiari are much more closely related to Persian, than Kurdish." The Bakhtiari dialect is considered a middle Persian dialect which could survive through history.  There do exist transitional dialects between Southern Kurdish and Lori-Bakhtiāri', and Lori-Bakhtiāri itself may be called a transitional idiom between Kurdish and Persian, with most of the language originating from Persian.</p>

It was not a written language until 1995, when linguist Bert Vaux designed an orthographic system for it based on the Turkish alphabet; the Armenian alphabet was used by Christian immigrants from Hamshen (Northern Hamshenis)—who refer to the language as <b>Homshetsma</b> (Հոմշեցմա) in Russia and Abkhazia. </p><p>Homshetsi is a spoken language amongst the Eastern Hemshinli, also known as the Hopa Hemshinli, who live in a small number of villages in Turkey's Artvin Province and Central Asia. The Western or Rize Hamsheni are a related, geographically separate group living in Rize Province, who spoke Homshetsi until sometime in the 19th century. They now speak only Turkish with many Homshetsi loanwords. A third group, the northern Homshentsik, who live in Russia, Georgia (Abkhazia), Armenia, also speak Homshetsi. </p><p>Homshetsi has linguistic features that indicate it belongs to the Western Armenian dialect group; however, the two are generally not mutually intelligible. Homshetsi has close ties to the Armenian dialects formerly found in northeastern Turkey, in particular in Khodorchur and, to a lesser extent, in Trabzon. Because of its extended isolation, Homshetsi contains many archaisms that set it apart from all other Armenian dialects. The language preserves forms found only in Classical and Middle Armenian, and at the same time preserves foreign (especially Arab and Turkish) grammatical and lexical components that were stripped from modern Armenian during the twentieth century. "Homshetsma therefore gives us one of our only glimpses of Armenian in its 'pure' form", writes Bert Vaux.</p><p>UNESCO has categorised Homshetsi as a language that is "definitely endangered".</p>
